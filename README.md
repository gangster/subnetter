A command-line tool for hierarchical IPv4 CIDR allocation across cloud infrastructure.

## Project Status

Subnetter is currently in active development. The core functionality for CIDR allocation is implemented and available through both the CLI and programmatic API. The project follows a monorepo structure with comprehensive test coverage and documentation. We have recently optimized our CI/CD pipeline for faster builds and more efficient testing across multiple Node.js versions.

## Project Structure

Subnetter is organized as a monorepo with multiple packages:

- **@subnetter/core**: Core CIDR allocation engine and utilities
- **@subnetter/cli**: Command-line interface for the tool
- **@subnetter/docs**: Documentation site built with Astro and Starlight

This modular design allows you to use the core functionality programmatically while also providing a convenient CLI and comprehensive documentation.

## The Problem

Managing IP address space in modern cloud environments presents several challenges:

### IP Address Management Complexity
- **Manual allocation is error-prone**: Hand-crafting CIDR blocks for hundreds of subnets across multiple regions leads to mistakes
- **Overlapping CIDRs cause connectivity issues**: Without a systematic approach, IP conflicts can cause outages and security vulnerabilities
- **Multi-cloud environments multiply complexity**: Each cloud provider requires its own network architecture, but needs to integrate with others

### Scaling Challenges
- **Growing organizations quickly exhaust IP space**: Without proper planning, organizations need painful re-IP projects as they grow
- **Future-proofing is difficult**: Planning for expansion across regions, accounts, and cloud providers requires complex calculations
- **Consistent documentation is hard to maintain**: Network diagrams and spreadsheets become outdated as infrastructure evolves

### Operational Overhead
- **Tracking allocated CIDRs across teams**: Different teams deploy resources in different regions with no central coordination
- **Limited visibility across environments**: Network admins struggle to understand the global IP addressing picture
- **Automation integration requires structured data**: Infrastructure-as-code tools need consistent, predictable IP allocation

Subnetter solves these problems through automated, hierarchical CIDR allocation that ensures consistency, prevents overlaps, documents all allocations, and scales with your organizationâ€”whether you're managing a single VPC or hundreds of accounts across multiple cloud providers.

## Features

### Implemented Features

- **Hierarchical IPv4 CIDR Allocation**: Allocate IP address ranges in a hierarchical manner (account â†’ region â†’ availability zone â†’ subnet)
- **Multi-Cloud Provider Support**: Support for AWS, Azure, and GCP with provider-specific region naming conventions
- **Flexible Configuration System**: JSON/YAML configuration files with Zod schema validation
- **Deterministic Allocation**: Same input configuration always produces the same allocation results
- **CSV Output Format**: Generate allocations in CSV format for easy integration with other tools
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Hierarchical error system with specialized error types, error codes, context information, and actionable help text
- **Provider-Specific Filtering**: Filter allocation results by cloud provider
- **Variable Subnet Sizing**: Configure different prefix lengths for different subnet types based on workload requirements
- **Account-Level Overrides**: Specify different base CIDRs for specific accounts or cloud providers
- **Command-Line Interface**: Simple CLI for generating and validating allocations
- **Programmatic API**: Use core functionality in your own applications
- **Base CIDR Override**: Override the base CIDR block through command-line options
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: User guide, API reference, configuration reference and example scenarios

### Planned Features

- **IPv6 Support**: Extend allocation capabilities to IPv6 address space
- **Web Interface**: Provide a web-based UI for configuration and visualization
- **Terraform/CloudFormation Integration**: Direct integration with infrastructure-as-code tools
- **Custom Naming Conventions**: Allow customization of naming patterns for subnets and other resources
- **Visualization Tools**: Generate network diagrams from allocation results
- **IP Address Management (IPAM) Integration**: Integration with existing IPAM solutions

## Installation

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g subnetter

# Or use with npx
npx subnetter
```

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: ^18.18.0 || ^20.9.0 || >=21.1.0
- **npm or yarn**: For package installation

## Development Setup

### Package Manager

This project uses Yarn exclusively as the package manager with a zero-install configuration:

- Yarn binary is included in the repository (`.yarn/releases/yarn-sources.cjs`)
- No global Yarn installation is required
- The project uses Yarn Workspaces for monorepo management

To work with this repository:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/gangster/subnetter.git
cd subnetter

# Use the included Yarn version
./yarn install

# Build all packages
./yarn build
```

### Build System

The project uses TypeScript's project references for a fast, reliable build process:

- Root `tsconfig.json` references individual package configurations
- Each package has its own `tsconfig.json` with specific settings
- CommonJS module format is used for compatibility

Build commands:

```bash
# Build all packages
yarn build

# Build specific packages
yarn build:core
yarn build:cli
yarn build:docs

# Development mode with watch
yarn dev
```

## Programmatic Usage

You can also use the tool programmatically in your Node.js applications:

```javascript
// Import from the core package
const { loadConfig, CidrAllocator, writeAllocationsToCsv } = require('@subnetter/core');

async function generateAllocations() {
  try {
    // Load configuration (JSON or YAML formats are supported)
    const config = loadConfig('config.json'); // or 'config.yaml'
    
    // Generate allocations
    const allocator = new CidrAllocator(config);
    const allocations = allocator.generateAllocations();
    
    console.log(`Generated ${allocations.length} subnet allocations`);
    
    // Write to CSV
    await writeAllocationsToCsv(allocations, 'allocations.csv');
    console.log('Allocations written to CSV');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error:', error.message);
  }
}

generateAllocations();
```

## Testing

Subnetter uses a comprehensive test suite organized by packages:

- **Package Tests**: Each package (`core`, `cli`) contains its own tests in the `tests/` directory
- **End-to-End Tests**: Integration tests that verify the complete workflow are located in `__tests__/e2e/`

To run tests:

```bash
# Run all package tests
yarn test

# Run tests with coverage for all packages
yarn test:coverage

# Run end-to-end tests
yarn test:e2e

# Merge coverage reports from different test runs
yarn test:coverage:merge

# Run tests for a specific package
yarn workspace @subnetter/core test
yarn workspace @subnetter/cli test

# Run linting across all packages
yarn lint
```
