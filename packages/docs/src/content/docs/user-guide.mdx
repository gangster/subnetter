## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js: ^18.18.0 || ^20.9.0 || >=21.1.0
- npm or yarn

### Global Installation

To install Subnetter globally, which allows you to run it from anywhere on your system:

```bash
# Using npm
npm install -g subnetter

# Using yarn (recommended)
yarn global add subnetter
```

**Note**: While npm installation is supported, Yarn is the officially supported package manager for this project and is recommended for the best experience.

### Local Installation

For project-specific use, you can install it as a local dependency:

```bash
# Using npm
npm install subnetter

# Using yarn (recommended)
yarn add subnetter
```

### For Contributors

If you're contributing to Subnetter, the project uses Yarn exclusively with a zero-install configuration:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gangster/subnetter.git
   cd subnetter
   ```

2. No need to install Yarn globally - the project uses Yarn from the `.yarn/releases` directory.

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   ./yarn install
   ```

4. Build the packages:
   ```bash
   ./yarn build
   ```

For more details on the development setup, see the [Developer Guide](../developer-guide/).

### Verification

Verify the installation by checking the version:

```bash
subnetter --version
```

## Quick Start

Let's create a simple allocation plan for a single cloud provider with a few accounts:

1. Create a configuration file named `config.json`:

```json
{
  "baseCidr": "10.0.0.0/8",
  "cloudProviders": ["aws"],
  "accounts": [
    {
      "name": "production",
      "clouds": {
        "aws": {
          "regions": ["us-east-1", "us-west-2"]
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "development",
      "clouds": {
        "aws": {
          "regions": ["us-east-1"]
        }
      }
    }
  ],
  "subnetTypes": {
    "Public": 24,
    "Private": 26,
    "Data": 27
  }
}
```

2. Generate allocations:

```bash
subnetter generate --config config.json --output allocations.csv
```

3. Examine the generated CSV file to see your IP allocations.

## Getting Started

### Basic Usage

The tool has two main commands:

1. `generate`: Generates CIDR allocations based on a configuration file
2. `validate`: Validates a configuration file without generating allocations

#### Generate Allocations

```bash
subnetter generate --config config.json --output allocations.csv
```

#### Validate Configuration

```bash
subnetter validate --config config.json
```

## Configuration File

The configuration file is a JSON file that defines the structure of your network architecture and how CIDRs should be allocated.

### Minimal Configuration

Here's a minimal configuration file:

```json
{
  "baseCidr": "10.0.0.0/8",
  "cloudProviders": ["aws"],
  "accounts": [
    {
      "name": "example-account",
      "clouds": {
        "aws": {
          "regions": ["us-east-1"]
        }
      }
    }
  ],
  "subnetTypes": {
    "Public": 24,
    "Private": 26
  }
}
```

### Full Configuration Example

Here's a more complete example with all possible options:

```json
{
  "baseCidr": "10.0.0.0/8",
  "prefixLengths": {
    "account": 16,  // /16 for accounts
    "region": 20,   // /20 for regions
    "az": 22        // /22 for availability zones
  },
  "cloudProviders": [
    "aws",
    "azure",
    "gcp"
  ],
  "accounts": [
    {
      "name": "multicloud-account",
      "clouds": {
        "aws": {
          "baseCidr": "10.100.0.0/16",
          "regions": ["us-east-1", "us-west-2"]
        },
        "azure": {
          "baseCidr": "10.101.0.0/16",
          "regions": ["eastus", "westeurope"]
        },
        "gcp": {
          "baseCidr": "10.102.0.0/16",
          "regions": ["us-central1", "europe-west1"]
        }
      }
    }
  ],
  "subnetTypes": {
    "Public": 24,
    "Private": 25,
    "Data": 26,
    "Management": 27
  }
}
```

### Configuration Schema

The configuration file must follow this schema:

#### baseCidr

The base CIDR block from which all other CIDRs will be allocated. This should be a large CIDR block, typically a /8, /12, or /16.

```json
"baseCidr": "10.0.0.0/8"
```

#### prefixLengths

(Optional) Specifies the prefix lengths to use for each level of the hierarchy. If not specified, default values will be used.

```json
"prefixLengths": {
  "account": 16,  // /16 for accounts
  "region": 20,   // /20 for regions
  "az": 22        // /22 for availability zones
}
```

#### cloudProviders

List of cloud providers to be used in the configuration. Supported values are "aws", "azure", and "gcp".

```json
"cloudProviders": ["aws", "azure", "gcp"]
```

#### accounts

List of accounts for which to allocate CIDR blocks. Each account must have a unique name and one or more cloud-specific configurations.

```json
"accounts": [
  {
    "name": "account-name",
    "clouds": {
      // Cloud-specific configurations
    }
  }
]
```

#### clouds

Each account has cloud-specific configurations, organized by cloud provider:

```json
"clouds": {
  "aws": {
    "baseCidr": "10.0.0.0/16", // Optional, overrides the global baseCidr
    "regions": ["us-east-1", "us-west-2"]
  },
  "azure": {
    "baseCidr": "10.101.0.0/16",
    "regions": ["eastus", "westeurope"]
  }
}
```

#### subnetTypes

Defines the types of subnets to allocate in each availability zone.

```json
"subnetTypes": {
  "Public": 24,
  "Private": 25,
  "Data": 26,
  "Management": 27
}
```

Each subnet type has a different prefix length, allowing for different subnet sizes. For example, a subnet with prefix length 24 provides 254 usable IP addresses, while a subnet with prefix length 27 provides only 30 usable IP addresses.

## Advanced Usage

### Filtering by Cloud Provider

You can filter the output to include only allocations for a specific cloud provider:

```bash
subnetter generate --config config.json --output allocations.csv --provider aws
```

### Overriding Base CIDR

You can override the base CIDR block specified in the configuration:

```bash
subnetter generate --config config.json --output allocations.csv --base-cidr 172.16.0.0/12
```

### Verbose Output

For more detailed output, you can use the verbose flag:

```bash
subnetter generate --config config.json --output allocations.csv --verbose
```

## Best Practices

### CIDR Allocation Strategy

1. **Plan your Address Space**: Start with a large CIDR block (like 10.0.0.0/8) to accommodate future growth.
2. **Reserve Space for Expansion**: When allocating CIDRs, leave room for adding more accounts, regions, or subnets in the future.
3. **Use Type-Specific Subnet Sizes**: Allocate larger subnets for workloads that need more IPs, and smaller subnets for others.

### Example Sizing Guidelines

| Subnet Type | Suggested Prefix Length | Number of IPs | Usable IPs |
|-------------|-------------------------|---------------|------------|
| Public      | /24                     | 256           | 254        |
| Private     | /23 to /25              | 512 to 128    | 510 to 126 |
| Data        | /26                     | 64            | 62         |
| Management  | /27 to /28              | 32 to 16      | 30 to 14   |

### CIDR Allocation Patterns

There are several common patterns for allocating CIDRs in cloud environments:

#### 1. Account-Based Isolation

For organizations with strict account isolation requirements:

```
10.0.0.0/8 (Base)
│
├── 10.0.0.0/16 - Account A (Development)
│   ├── 10.0.0.0/20 - us-east-1
│   └── 10.0.16.0/20 - us-west-2
│
├── 10.1.0.0/16 - Account B (Testing)
│   ├── 10.1.0.0/20 - us-east-1
│   └── 10.1.16.0/20 - us-west-2
│
└── 10.2.0.0/16 - Account C (Production)
    ├── 10.2.0.0/20 - us-east-1
    └── 10.2.16.0/20 - us-west-2
```

This pattern:
- Ensures complete isolation between accounts
- Makes network ACLs and security groups easier to manage
- Simplifies compliance and auditing
- Works well for multi-tenant environments

**Example config snippet**:
```json
{
  "baseCidr": "10.0.0.0/8",
  "prefixLengths": {
    "account": 16,
    "region": 20
  },
  "accounts": [
    {
      "name": "development",
      "clouds": {
        "aws": {
          "regions": ["us-east-1", "us-west-2"]
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "testing",
      "clouds": {
        "aws": {
          "regions": ["us-east-1", "us-west-2"]
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "production",
      "clouds": {
        "aws": {
          "regions": ["us-east-1", "us-west-2"]
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

#### 2. Environment-Based Isolation

For organizations with multiple environments in each account:

```
10.0.0.0/8 (Base)
│
├── 10.0.0.0/12 - Development Environments
│   ├── 10.0.0.0/16 - Account A Dev
│   ├── 10.1.0.0/16 - Account B Dev
│   └── 10.2.0.0/16 - Account C Dev
│
├── 10.16.0.0/12 - Testing Environments
│   ├── 10.16.0.0/16 - Account A Test
│   ├── 10.17.0.0/16 - Account B Test
│   └── 10.18.0.0/16 - Account C Test
│
└── 10.32.0.0/12 - Production Environments
    ├── 10.32.0.0/16 - Account A Prod
    ├── 10.33.0.0/16 - Account B Prod
    └── 10.34.0.0/16 - Account C Prod
```

This pattern:
- Groups environments together
- Helps maintain consistency across environments
- Simplifies routing and firewall rules
- Supports clear environment separation

#### 3. Cloud Provider Isolation

For organizations using multiple cloud providers:

```
10.0.0.0/8 (Base)
│
├── 10.0.0.0/12 - AWS
│   ├── 10.0.0.0/16 - Account A
│   ├── 10.1.0.0/16 - Account B
│   └── 10.2.0.0/16 - Account C
│
├── 10.16.0.0/12 - Azure
│   ├── 10.16.0.0/16 - Account A
│   ├── 10.17.0.0/16 - Account B
│   └── 10.18.0.0/16 - Account C
│
└── 10.32.0.0/12 - GCP
    ├── 10.32.0.0/16 - Account A
    ├── 10.33.0.0/16 - Account B
    └── 10.34.0.0/16 - Account C
```

This pattern:
- Separates cloud providers
- Simplifies provider-specific routing
- Makes interconnectivity easier to manage
- Supports clear provider boundaries

**Example config snippet**:
```json
{
  "baseCidr": "10.0.0.0/8",
  "accounts": [
    {
      "name": "account-a",
      "clouds": {
        "aws": {
          "baseCidr": "10.0.0.0/16",
          "regions": ["us-east-1", "us-west-2"]
        },
        "azure": {
          "baseCidr": "10.16.0.0/16",
          "regions": ["eastus", "westeurope"]
        },
        "gcp": {
          "baseCidr": "10.32.0.0/16",
          "regions": ["us-central1", "europe-west1"]
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Subnet Type Strategy

When defining subnet types, consider these patterns:

#### 1. Workload-Based Subnet Types

```json
"subnetTypes": {
  "Public": 24,
  "WebTier": 24,
  "AppTier": 24,
  "DataTier": 26,
  "Management": 28
}
```

This pattern:
- Aligns subnets with application tiers
- Allocates appropriate space for each tier
- Supports clear security boundaries

#### 2. Function-Based Subnet Types

```json
"subnetTypes": {
  "LoadBalancer": 28,
  "WebServers": 24,
  "Containers": 22,
  "Databases": 26,
  "CacheServices": 27
}
```

This pattern:
- Organizes by infrastructure function
- Allocates space based on deployment size
- Works well with microservice architectures

#### 3. Security-Based Subnet Types

```json
"subnetTypes": {
  "DMZ": 24,
  "Trusted": 23,
  "Restricted": 25,
  "HighSecurity": 26
}
```

This pattern:
- Aligns with security zones
- Supports defense-in-depth strategy
- Simplifies security group and NACL design

### Naming Conventions

Use consistent naming conventions for accounts, regions, and subnet types. This makes the output easier to understand and work with.

#### Account Naming

Common patterns include:
- Environment-based: `prod`, `staging`, `dev`, `test`
- Business unit-based: `finance`, `marketing`, `operations`
- Project-based: `project-alpha`, `initiative-beta`

#### Subnet Type Naming

Clear subnet naming helps with visualization and planning:
- Role-based: `Public`, `Private`, `Protected`, `Isolated`
- Function-based: `Web`, `App`, `Data`, `Cache`, `Management`
- Traffic-based: `Ingress`, `Egress`, `Internal`, `Edge`

## Real-World Examples

        "aws": {
          "regions": ["us-east-1", "eu-west-1", "ap-southeast-1"]
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "saas-tenant-tier2",
      "clouds": {
        "aws": {
          "regions": ["us-east-1", "us-west-2"]
        }
      }
    },

### Version Control

Store your configuration files in version control to track changes and maintain a history of your network architecture.

#### Best Practices for Configuration in Version Control

1. **Use branching strategies**: Create branches for major network changes
2. **Review before merging**: Peer review for CIDR allocation changes
3. **Tag releases**: Tag confirmed and applied configurations
4. **Include documentation**: Add comments explaining design decisions
5. **Store generated outputs**: Save generated allocations alongside configs

Example Git workflow:
```bash
# Clone the network configurations repository
git clone https://github.com/company/network-configs
cd network-configs

# Create a branch for your changes
git checkout -b add-new-region

# Edit configuration file
vim configs/production.json

# Generate and verify allocations
subnetter generate --config configs/production.json --output allocations/production.csv

# Commit changes with descriptive message
git add configs/production.json allocations/production.csv
git commit -m "Add ap-southeast-2 region to production account"

# Push for review
git push origin add-new-region

# After review, merge to main
git checkout main
git merge add-new-region
git push origin main

# Tag the released config
git tag -a v1.2.0 -m "Production network v1.2.0 with AP Southeast 2 region"
git push origin v1.2.0
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. Not Enough Space Error

**Problem**: `Allocation Error: Not enough space to allocate 4 subnets with prefix length /24 in CIDR 10.0.0.0/22`

**Solutions**:
- Increase the size of the parent CIDR block
- Reduce the number of subnets
- Use smaller subnets (larger prefix length)
- Check for inefficient nesting or wasted space

```json
// BEFORE (error)
{
  "subnetTypes": {
    "Public": 24,
    "Private": 24,
    "Data": 24,
    "Management": 24
  }
}

// AFTER (fixed)
{
  "subnetTypes": {
    "Public": 26,
    "Private": 25,
    "Data": 26,
    "Management": 27
  }
}
```

#### 2. Prefix Length Too Large

**Problem**: `CIDR Error: New prefix length (33) cannot be greater than 32`

**Solutions**:
- Reduce the number of items at one or more levels
- Explicitly specify smaller prefix lengths in the configuration
- Consolidate accounts or regions to reduce hierarchy depth

#### 3. Overlapping CIDRs

**Problem**: `Allocation Error: CIDR 10.0.0.0/16 overlaps with existing CIDR 10.0.0.0/8`

**Solutions**:
- Use distinct CIDR ranges for different entities
- Check for duplicate provider or region entries
- Ensure cloud-specific base CIDRs don't overlap

```json
// BEFORE (error)
{
  "baseCidr": "10.0.0.0/8",
  "accounts": [
    {
      "name": "account-a",
      "clouds": {
        "aws": {
          "baseCidr": "10.0.0.0/16" // Contained within baseCidr
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "account-b",
      "clouds": {
        "aws": {
          "regions": [] // Will also use part of 10.0.0.0/8
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}

// AFTER (fixed)
{
  "baseCidr": "10.0.0.0/8",
  "accounts": [
    {
      "name": "account-a",
      "clouds": {
        "aws": {
          "baseCidr": "172.16.0.0/16" // Separate range
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "account-b",
      "clouds": {
        "aws": {
          "regions": [] // Will use part of 10.0.0.0/8
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Diagnostic Mode

For troubleshooting complex issues, use the verbose flag to see detailed allocation steps:

```bash
subnetter generate --config config.json --output allocations.csv --verbose
```

This will show:
- Configuration after validation and defaults
- Each step in the allocation process
- Calculated prefix lengths
- CIDR subdivisions at each level
- Any warnings or potential issues

## Integration with IaC Tools

### Terraform Integration

You can use Subnetter's output to define your Terraform resources:

1. Generate your CIDR allocations:
   ```bash
   subnetter generate --config network.json --output network.csv
   ```

2. Parse the CSV in your Terraform code:
   ```hcl
   locals {
     cidr_allocations = csvdecode(file("${path.module}/network.csv"))
     
     # Filter for specific resources
     vpc_cidrs = {
       for row in local.cidr_allocations :
       "${row.Account Name}-${row.Cloud Provider}" => row.VPC CIDR
       if row.Subnet Role == "Public" && row.Availability Zone == "${row.Region Name}a"
     }
     
     subnet_cidrs = {
       for row in local.cidr_allocations :
       "${row.Account Name}-${row.Region Name}-${row.Availability Zone}-${row.Subnet Role}" => row.Subnet CIDR
     }
   }
   
   # Create VPCs using the allocations
   resource "aws_vpc" "this" {
     for_each = {
       for k, v in local.vpc_cidrs :
       k => v
       if can(regex("aws", k))
     }
     
     cidr_block = each.value
     tags = {
       Name = each.key
     }
   }
   
   # Create subnets using the allocations
   resource "aws_subnet" "this" {
     for_each = {
       for k, v in local.subnet_cidrs :
       k => v
       if can(regex("aws", k))
     }
     
     vpc_id     = aws_vpc.this["${split("-", each.key)[0]}-aws"].id
     cidr_block = each.value
     availability_zone = split("-", each.key)[2]
     
     tags = {
       Name = each.key
       Role = split("-", each.key)[3]
     }
   }
   ```

### CloudFormation Integration

For CloudFormation, you can generate a parameters file from the CSV output:

```bash
# Generate allocations
subnetter generate --config network.json --output network.csv

# Convert to CloudFormation parameters (using jq)
jq -R 'split("\n") | .[1:] | map(split(",")) | map(select(length > 1)) | map({ 
  "ParameterKey": (.[0] + .[2] + .[3] + .[4] + .[10] | gsub("[^a-zA-Z0-9]"; "") + "CidrParam"),
  "ParameterValue": .[8]
})' network.csv > cfn-params.json
```

Then reference these parameters in your CloudFormation template.

## Advanced Usage Patterns

### Dynamic Region Detection

For cloud providers that regularly add new regions, you can use wildcard patterns in your configuration:

```json
{
  "cloudProviders": ["aws"],
  "accounts": [
    {
      "name": "global-services",
      "clouds": {
        "aws": {
          "regions": ["*-1"]
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Reserved CIDR Blocks

For future expansion or special use cases, you can reserve CIDR blocks:

```json
{
  "baseCidr": "10.0.0.0/8",
  "accounts": [
    {
      "name": "current",
      "clouds": {
        "aws": {
          "baseCidr": "10.0.0.0/10",  // Use only half of the space
          "regions": ["us-east-1", "us-west-2"]
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "reserved-future",
      "clouds": {
        "aws": {
          "baseCidr": "10.64.0.0/10",  // Reserve the other half
          "regions": []
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Multi-Tenant Architecture

For SaaS providers with multi-tenant architecture:

```json
{
  "baseCidr": "10.0.0.0/8",
  "accounts": [
    {
      "name": "shared-infrastructure",
      "clouds": {
        "aws": {
          "baseCidr": "10.0.0.0/12",
          "regions": ["us-east-1", "us-west-2", "eu-west-1", "ap-southeast-1"]
        }
      }
    }
  ],
  "subnetTypes": {
    "Tenant1": 24,
    "Tenant2": 24,
    "Tenant3": 24,
    "Tenant4": 24,
    "SharedServices": 24,
    "Management": 26
  }
}
```

### Hybrid Cloud Architecture

For organizations with on-premises and cloud environments:

```json
{
  "baseCidr": "10.0.0.0/8",
  "accounts": [
    {
      "name": "on-premises",
      "clouds": {
        "datacenter": {
          "regions": ["dc1", "dc2"]
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "cloud-primary",
      "clouds": {
        "aws": {
          "regions": ["us-east-1", "us-west-2"]
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "cloud-secondary",
      "clouds": {
        "azure": {
          "regions": ["eastus", "westeurope"]
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Example Scenarios

This section presents hypothetical scenarios showing how organizations could use Subnetter to solve complex IP addressing challenges across different environments and use cases.

### Enterprise Multi-Cloud Migration

#### Challenge

A large enterprise with 10,000+ employees needs to migrate from a legacy on-premises infrastructure to a multi-cloud architecture across AWS, Azure, and GCP. The organization has the following requirements:

* Support for 4 distinct environments (Development, Test, Pre-Production, Production)
* Global presence across 15+ regions worldwide
* Consistent networking model across all cloud providers
* No IP address overlaps with existing on-premises networks (10.0.0.0/16 and 172.16.0.0/12)
* Room for future expansion

#### Solution

The organization could use Subnetter to create a comprehensive IP addressing plan:

```json
{
  "baseCidr": "192.168.0.0/8",
  "prefixLengths": {
    "account": 16,
    "region": 20,
    "az": 22,
    "subnet": 24
  },
  "cloudProviders": ["aws", "azure", "gcp"],
  "accounts": [
    {
      "name": "dev",
      "clouds": {
        "aws": {
          "baseCidr": "192.0.0.0/16",
          "regions": ["us-east-1", "eu-west-1", "ap-southeast-1"]
        },
        "azure": {
          "baseCidr": "192.1.0.0/16",
          "regions": ["eastus", "westeurope", "southeastasia"]
        },
        "gcp": {
          "baseCidr": "192.2.0.0/16",
          "regions": ["us-central1", "europe-west1", "asia-southeast1"]
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "test",
      "clouds": {
        "aws": {
          "baseCidr": "192.3.0.0/16",
          "regions": ["us-east-1", "eu-west-1", "ap-southeast-1"]
        },
        "azure": {
          "baseCidr": "192.4.0.0/16",
          "regions": ["eastus", "westeurope", "southeastasia"]
        },
        "gcp": {
          "baseCidr": "192.5.0.0/16",
          "regions": ["us-central1", "europe-west1", "asia-southeast1"]
        }
      }
    }
    // Pre-prod and prod configurations follow the same pattern
  ],
  "subnetTypes": {
    "Public": 24,
    "Private": 23,
    "Database": 25,
    "Management": 26
  }
}
```

#### Cloud Resource Mapping

This allocation would create the following cloud resources:

* **AWS**: Each account gets its own unique VPC in each region (e.g., dev-us-east-1-vpc: 192.0.0.0/20)  
   * Each VPC contains subnets in all availability zones (us-east-1a, us-east-1b, etc.)  
   * Each AZ contains four subnet types, sized appropriately:  
         * Public subnets (/24): 254 usable IPs for load balancers, bastion hosts  
         * Private subnets (/23): 510 usable IPs for application workloads  
         * Database subnets (/25): 126 usable IPs for RDS/database instances  
         * Management subnets (/26): 62 usable IPs for control plane services
* **Azure**: Each account gets dedicated Virtual Networks in each region  
   * Subnets follow the same sizing as AWS for consistency  
   * Cross-provider integration is simplified by non-overlapping CIDRs
* **GCP**: Each account gets dedicated VPC networks in each region  
   * Subnets are created per region (not per AZ since GCP uses a different availability model)

#### Key Takeaways

* Using different base CIDRs for different cloud providers simplifies firewall rules
* Subnet-specific prefix lengths allow efficient use of IP space (larger subnets for workloads requiring more IPs)
* Hierarchical approach makes it easy to add new regions later

### Startup Scaling from Single to Multi-Region

#### Challenge

A fast-growing SaaS startup initially deployed their application in a single AWS region (us-west-2). As they expand internationally, they need to:

* Deploy to 3 additional regions (us-east-1, eu-west-1, ap-southeast-1)
* Maintain existing IP allocations in us-west-2 to avoid disruption
* Allow for future expansion to more regions
* Support different subnet sizes based on workload requirements

#### Solution

The startup could use Subnetter to create an expandable allocation plan:

```json
{
  "baseCidr": "10.0.0.0/16",
  "prefixLengths": {
    "account": 16,
    "region": 19,
    "az": 21
  },
  "cloudProviders": ["aws"],
  "accounts": [
    {
      "name": "production",
      "clouds": {
        "aws": {
          "regions": ["us-west-2", "us-east-1", "eu-west-1", "ap-southeast-1"]
        }
      }
    }
  ],
  "subnetTypes": {
    "Public": 24,
    "Application": 22,
    "Database": 25,
    "Cache": 26,
    "Management": 27
  }
}
```

#### Expansion Strategy

This allocation enables:

1. **Preserving Existing Allocations**: The first CIDRs allocated will match their existing us-west-2 allocations
2. **Region-Specific Allocations**: Each region gets a clear CIDR block:
   * us-west-2: 10.0.0.0/19
   * us-east-1: 10.0.32.0/19
   * eu-west-1: 10.0.64.0/19
   * ap-southeast-1: 10.0.96.0/19
3. **Additional Future Regions**: Space for 4 more regions is reserved
4. **Workload-Appropriate Subnets**: Larger subnets (/22) for application tier, smaller subnets for specialized workloads

#### Key Takeaways

* Using a structured allocation approach allows for predictable expansion
* Workload-specific subnet sizes optimize IP allocation
* Clear documentation helps prevent IP conflicts as the environment grows

### Financial Services Compliance

#### Challenge

A financial services organization needs to implement cloud networking that meets stringent regulatory requirements:

* Complete network isolation between different banking functions
* Auditable boundaries between environment tiers
* Multi-layer security zones with varying security levels
* Comprehensive logging and monitoring
* Support for both AWS and Azure (multi-cloud strategy)

#### Solution

The organization could use Subnetter to implement a compliant architecture:

```json
{
  "baseCidr": "10.0.0.0/8",
  "prefixLengths": {
    "account": 16,
    "region": 20,
    "az": 22
  },
  "cloudProviders": ["aws", "azure"],
  "accounts": [
    {
      "name": "finance-shared-services",
      "clouds": {
        "aws": {
          "baseCidr": "10.1.0.0/16",
          "regions": ["us-east-1", "us-west-2", "eu-west-1", "ap-southeast-1"]
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "finance-retail-banking",
      "clouds": {
        "aws": {
          "baseCidr": "10.2.0.0/16",
          "regions": ["us-east-1", "us-west-2", "eu-west-1"]
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "finance-investment",
      "clouds": {
        "aws": {
          "baseCidr": "10.3.0.0/16",
          "regions": ["us-east-1", "us-west-2"]
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "finance-insurance",
      "clouds": {
        "azure": {
          "regions": ["eastus", "westeurope"]
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "finance-analytics",
      "clouds": {
        "gcp": {
          "regions": ["us-central1", "europe-west1"]
        }
      }
    }
  ],
  "subnetTypes": {
    "DMZ": 24,
    "Presentation": 24,
    "Application": 23,
    "Data": 25,
    "HighSecurity": 26,
    "Management": 28,
    "Audit": 27
  }
}
```

#### Security Architecture

This allocation enables a security architecture with:

1. **Account-Level Isolation**: Each banking function gets its own dedicated account
2. **Regional Compliance**: Different regions for different regulatory jurisdictions
3. **Security Zones**: Multiple subnet tiers with different security postures
   * DMZ zone: Internet-facing services with tightly controlled access
   * Presentation tier: Web applications with carefully restricted connectivity
   * Application tier: Business logic with no direct external access
   * Data tier: Databases with strictly limited connectivity
   * High-security zone: Sensitive systems with highly restricted access
4. **Audit Infrastructure**: Dedicated subnets for logging, monitoring, and audit systems

#### Key Takeaways

* Account-level isolation provides strong security boundaries
* Different subnet types enable appropriate security controls for each tier
* Multi-cloud strategy allows for provider-specific compliance features
* Clear IP boundaries facilitate audit and documentation

### Hybrid Cloud Implementation

#### Challenge

A media production company plans to implement a hybrid cloud architecture that spans their on-premises data centers and multiple cloud providers. They require:

* Seamless connectivity between on-premises and cloud resources
* Consistent IP addressing across all environments
* Separate address spaces for different workload types
* Support for AWS and Azure as primary cloud providers
* Reserved space for GCP expansion in the future

#### Solution

The company could use Subnetter to create a comprehensive hybrid architecture:

```json

  "baseCidr": "10.0.0.0/8",
  "prefixLengths": {
    "account": 16,
    "region": 20,
    "az": 22
  },
  "cloudProviders": ["aws", "azure", "gcp"],
  "accounts": [
    {
      "name": "on-premises",
      "clouds": {
        "datacenter": {
          "regions": ["dc1", "dc2"]
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "cloud-primary",
      "clouds": {
        "aws": {
          "regions": ["us-east-1", "us-west-2"]
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "cloud-secondary",
      "clouds": {
        "azure": {
          "regions": ["eastus", "westeurope"]
        }
      }
    }
  ],
  "subnetTypes": {
    "MediaIngest": 24,
    "MediaProcessing": 22,
    "MediaDelivery": 23,
    "MediaArchive": 24,
    "SharedServices": 25,
    "Management": 26
  }
}
```

#### Integration Architecture

This allocation enables:

1. **Consistent Addressing**: The same IP structure is used across on-premises and cloud environments
2. **Workload-Specific Allocations**: Different subnet types for different media workloads:
   * Media Ingest: For receiving raw content from cameras and production systems
   * Media Processing: Larger subnets (/22) for compute-intensive rendering and processing
   * Media Delivery: For content distribution infrastructure
   * Media Archive: For long-term storage systems
3. **Shared Services**: Common services that span environments
4. **Management Infrastructure**: Dedicated management plane for operations

#### Network Integration

* Direct Connect/ExpressRoute circuits connect on-premises and cloud environments
* VPN tunnels provide secure backup connectivity
* Consistent routing tables across all environments
* Shared services accessible from all environments

#### Key Takeaways

* Consistent addressing simplifies network integration
* Workload-specific subnet sizing optimizes IP allocation
* Reserved space for future expansion supports business growth

### Mergers and Acquisitions

#### Challenge

A large technology conglomerate regularly acquires smaller companies and needs to integrate them into its cloud infrastructure. The challenges include:

* Dealing with overlapping IP address spaces
* Standardizing network architecture across acquired companies
* Maintaining temporary isolation during migration
* Supporting both AWS and Azure environments
* Planning for future acquisitions

#### Solution

The conglomerate could use Subnetter to implement an acquisition-friendly architecture:

```json
{
  "baseCidr": "10.0.0.0/8",
  "prefixLengths": {
    "account": 16,
    "region": 20,
    "az": 22
  },
  "cloudProviders": ["aws", "azure", "gcp"],
  "accounts": [
    {
      "name": "parent-company",
      "clouds": {
        "aws": {
          "baseCidr": "10.0.0.0/12",
          "regions": ["us-east-1", "us-west-2", "eu-west-1", "ap-southeast-1"]
        },
        "azure": {
          "baseCidr": "10.16.0.0/12",
          "regions": ["eastus", "westeurope", "southeastasia"]
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "acquisition-1",

#### Acquisition Integration Strategy

This allocation enables:

1. **Parent Company Infrastructure**: Large allocations for the parent company's established resources
2. **Acquisition-Specific Spaces**: Dedicated address spaces for each acquisition
3. **Reserved Future Space**: Pre-allocated space for future acquisitions
4. **Migration Subnets**: Dedicated subnets for migration activities
5. **Multi-Cloud Support**: Consistent addressing across AWS and Azure resources

#### Migration Process

For each acquisition:
1. Allocate dedicated CIDR ranges using Subnetter
2. Set up temporary connectivity between acquired resources and parent infrastructure
3. Gradually migrate services to standardized architecture
4. Reallocate address space as needed for efficiency

#### Key Takeaways

* Reserved address blocks prevent fragmentation during acquisitions
* Standardized subnet types enforce architectural consistency
* Migration-specific subnets facilitate orderly transitions

## Understanding CIDR Allocation

### How the Allocation Algorithm Works

Subnetter uses a sophisticated, deterministic algorithm for allocating CIDR blocks. Understanding how this algorithm works will help you design your network architecture more effectively.

#### Hierarchical Allocation

The allocation process follows a strict hierarchy:

1. **Base CIDR**: The starting point for all allocations (e.g., `10.0.0.0/8`)
2. **Account Level**: Each account gets a portion of the base CIDR
3. **Region Level**: Each region gets a portion of its account's CIDR
4. **Availability Zone Level**: Each AZ gets a portion of its region's CIDR
5. **Subnet Level**: Each subnet type gets a portion of its AZ's CIDR

This hierarchical approach ensures that:
- Related resources are grouped together in the IP address space
- No overlaps occur between different parts of the hierarchy
- The allocation is deterministic and reproducible

#### Contiguous Allocation

At each level of the hierarchy, the allocation is performed contiguously. This means:

1. Blocks are allocated sequentially from the available space
2. Each new allocation starts immediately after the previous one
3. There are no gaps between allocations at the same level

For example, if you allocate a `/16` block for each account, they would be allocated as:
- Account 1: `10.0.0.0/16`
- Account 2: `10.1.0.0/16`
- Account 3: `10.2.0.0/16`

And so on.

### Customizing the Allocation Process

You can influence how the allocation works through several configuration options:

#### Prefix Lengths

The `prefixLengths` option lets you control the size of blocks allocated at each level:

```json
{
  "prefixLengths": {
    "account": 16,  // Each account gets a /16 (65,536 IPs)
    "region": 20,   // Each region gets a /20 (4,096 IPs)
    "az": 24        // Each AZ gets a /24 (256 IPs)
  }
}
```

Larger prefix numbers mean smaller blocks. For optimal allocation:
- Account prefix should be larger than the base CIDR prefix (e.g., `/16` for a `/8` base)
- Region prefix should be larger than account prefix (e.g., `/20` for `/16` accounts)
- AZ prefix should be larger than region prefix (e.g., `/24` for `/20` regions)

#### CIDR Overrides

You can override the allocation at various levels:

1. **Account Overrides**: Specify a `baseCidr` for an entire account
   ```json
   {
     "name": "production",
     "clouds": {
       "aws": {
         "provider": "aws",
         "baseCidr": "10.100.0.0/16"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Provider Overrides**: Use different address spaces for different cloud providers
   ```json
   {
     "name": "hybrid",
     "clouds": {
       "aws": {
         "provider": "aws",
         "baseCidr": "10.0.0.0/16"
       },
       "azure": {
         "provider": "azure",
         "baseCidr": "172.16.0.0/16"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. **CLI Overrides**: Override the base CIDR for all allocations
   ```bash
   subnetter generate -c config.json -b 192.168.0.0/16
   ```

### Space Utilization

Subnetter calculates the required space for each level of the hierarchy based on:
1. **Number of accounts**: Determines total accounts space needed
2. **Regions per account**: Determines per-account space needed
3. **AZs per region**: Determines per-region space needed
4. **Subnet types**: Determines per-AZ space needed

The tool will check if there's enough space for all allocations and provide clear error messages if not.

Example error:
```
[ERROR] [CLI] ❌ Error: [3002] Not enough space left for allocation with prefix /20
[INFO] [CLI] 💡 Help: Your CIDR block is too small for the requested allocation. Use a larger CIDR block or reduce the number of subnets.
```

### Handling IP Space Constraints

If you encounter space limitations, you have several options:

1. **Use a larger base CIDR**: Change from `10.0.0.0/8` to `0.0.0.0/0` to use the entire IPv4 space
2. **Reduce the number of regions**: Consolidate regions to reduce address space needs
3. **Use larger subnet prefixes**: Use `/27` instead of `/24` to create smaller subnets
4. **Override specific accounts**: Use custom CIDRs for accounts that need more space
5. **Split by provider**: Use different address spaces for different cloud providers

### Real-World Allocation Examples

#### Small Deployment (1 account, 2 regions, 3 subnets)

```json
{
  "baseCidr": "10.0.0.0/16",  // Smaller base for a small deployment
  "prefixLengths": {
    "account": 16,  // Single account gets the entire /16
    "region": 20,   // Each region gets a /20
    "az": 24        // Each AZ gets a /24
  },
  "accounts": [
    {
      "name": "startup",
      "clouds": {
        "aws": {
          "provider": "aws",
          "regions": ["us-east-1", "us-west-2"]
        }
      }
    }
  ],
  "subnetTypes": {
    "Public": 26,
    "Private": 26,
    "Database": 26
  }
}
```

Resulting allocations (simplified):
```
startup/aws/us-east-1/az-a/Public:   10.0.0.0/26
startup/aws/us-east-1/az-a/Private:  10.0.0.64/26
startup/aws/us-east-1/az-a/Database: 10.0.0.128/26
startup/aws/us-east-1/az-b/Public:   10.0.1.0/26
// ... and so on
```

#### Large Enterprise (4 accounts, multiple regions, custom overrides)

```json
{
  "baseCidr": "10.0.0.0/8",
  "prefixLengths": {
    "account": 16,
    "region": 20,
    "az": 24
  },
  "accounts": [
    {
      "name": "production",
      "clouds": {
        "aws": {
          "provider": "aws",
          "baseCidr": "10.100.0.0/16",
          "regions": ["us-east-1", "us-west-2", "eu-west-1", "ap-southeast-1"]
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "staging",
      "clouds": {
        "aws": {
          "provider": "aws",
          "baseCidr": "10.101.0.0/16",
          "regions": ["us-east-1", "eu-west-1"]
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "development",
      "clouds": {
        "aws": {
          "provider": "aws",
          "baseCidr": "10.102.0.0/16",
          "regions": ["us-east-1"]
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "tools",
      "clouds": {
        "aws": {
          "provider": "aws",
          "baseCidr": "10.103.0.0/16",
          "regions": ["us-east-1"]
        }
      }
    }
  ],
  "subnetTypes": {
    "Public": 26,
    "PrivateWebTier": 25,
    "PrivateAppTier": 24,
    "PrivateDataTier": 26,
    "Management": 27
  }
}
```

This configuration demonstrates how to use custom CIDR overrides to provide dedicated address spaces for each account with adequate space for multiple regions and subnet types.

## Cloud Provider Availability Zone Support

Subnetter provides accurate availability zone (AZ) naming for major cloud providers, respecting the unique naming patterns of each provider and region.

### AWS Availability Zones

AWS availability zones follow the pattern `region + letter` (e.g., `us-east-1a`). 

- Most AWS regions use sequential letters starting with `a` (a, b, c, ...)
- Some regions use non-sequential letters. For example:
  - `us-west-1` has only zones `a` and `c`
  - `ap-northeast-1` has zones `a`, `c`, and `d`

When specifying `azCount` in your configuration, Subnetter will generate the correct sequence of availability zone names for the specific region.

```json
{
  "cloudProviders": {
    "aws": {
      "regions": ["us-west-1", "ap-northeast-1"],
      "azCount": 3
    }
  }
}
```

With this configuration:
- For `us-west-1`, the AZs will be `["us-west-1a", "us-west-1c"]` (only 2 AZs are available)
- For `ap-northeast-1`, the AZs will be `["ap-northeast-1a", "ap-northeast-1c", "ap-northeast-1d"]`

### Azure Availability Zones

Azure availability zones use numbers (1, 2, 3) and are named as `region-number` (e.g., `eastus-1`). 

Not all Azure regions support availability zones. Subnetter validates zone support for regions and logs warnings when using AZs in unsupported regions.

Regions with AZ support include:
- `eastus`, `westeurope`, `centralus`, `northeurope`, and others

```json
{
  "cloudProviders": {
    "azure": {
      "regions": ["eastus", "brazilsoutheast"],
      "azCount": 3
    }
  }
}
```

With this configuration:
- For `eastus`, the AZs will be `["eastus-1", "eastus-2", "eastus-3"]`
- For `brazilsoutheast`, AZs will be created but a warning will be logged since this region doesn't officially support AZs

### GCP Availability Zones

GCP zones follow the pattern `region-letter` (e.g., `us-central1-a`). Like AWS, GCP also has region-specific zone patterns:

- Most regions use sequential letters (a, b, c, ...)
- Some regions like `us-east1` use specific letters (b, c, d)
- Regions like `europe-west1` also have specific patterns (b, c, d)

```json
{
  "cloudProviders": {
    "gcp": {
      "regions": ["us-central1", "us-east1"],
      "azCount": 3
    }
  }
}
```

With this configuration:
- For `us-central1`, the zones will be `["us-central1-a", "us-central1-b", "us-central1-c"]`
- For `us-east1`, the zones will be `["us-east1-b", "us-east1-c", "us-east1-d"]`

## Example Scenarios

This section presents hypothetical scenarios showing how organizations could use Subnetter to solve complex IP addressing challenges across different environments and use cases.

### Enterprise Multi-Cloud Migration

#### Challenge

A large enterprise with 10,000+ employees needs to migrate from a legacy on-premises infrastructure to a multi-cloud architecture across AWS, Azure, and GCP. The organization has the following requirements:

* Support for 4 distinct environments (Development, Test, Pre-Production, Production)
* Global presence across 15+ regions worldwide
* Consistent networking model across all cloud providers
* No IP address overlaps with existing on-premises networks (10.0.0.0/16 and 172.16.0.0/12)
* Room for future expansion

#### Solution

The organization could use Subnetter to create a comprehensive IP addressing plan:

```json
{
  "baseCidr": "192.168.0.0/8",
  "prefixLengths": {
    "account": 16,
    "region": 20,
    "az": 22,
    "subnet": 24
  },
  "cloudProviders": ["aws", "azure", "gcp"],
  "accounts": [
    {
      "name": "dev",
      "clouds": {
        "aws": {
          "baseCidr": "192.0.0.0/16",
          "regions": ["us-east-1", "eu-west-1", "ap-southeast-1"]
        },
        "azure": {
          "baseCidr": "192.1.0.0/16",
          "regions": ["eastus", "westeurope", "southeastasia"]
        },
        "gcp": {
          "baseCidr": "192.2.0.0/16",
          "regions": ["us-central1", "europe-west1", "asia-southeast1"]
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "test",
      "clouds": {
        "aws": {
          "baseCidr": "192.3.0.0/16",
          "regions": ["us-east-1", "eu-west-1", "ap-southeast-1"]
        },
        "azure": {
          "baseCidr": "192.4.0.0/16",
          "regions": ["eastus", "westeurope", "southeastasia"]
        },
        "gcp": {
          "baseCidr": "192.5.0.0/16",
          "regions": ["us-central1", "europe-west1", "asia-southeast1"]
        }
      }
    }
    // Pre-prod and prod configurations follow the same pattern
  ],
  "subnetTypes": {
    "Public": 24,
    "Private": 23,
    "Database": 25,
    "Management": 26
  }
}
```

#### Cloud Resource Mapping

This allocation would create the following cloud resources:

* **AWS**: Each account gets its own unique VPC in each region (e.g., dev-us-east-1-vpc: 192.0.0.0/20)  
   * Each VPC contains subnets in all availability zones (us-east-1a, us-east-1b, etc.)  
   * Each AZ contains four subnet types, sized appropriately:  
         * Public subnets (/24): 254 usable IPs for load balancers, bastion hosts  
         * Private subnets (/23): 510 usable IPs for application workloads  
         * Database subnets (/25): 126 usable IPs for RDS/database instances  
         * Management subnets (/26): 62 usable IPs for control plane services
* **Azure**: Each account gets dedicated Virtual Networks in each region  
   * Subnets follow the same sizing as AWS for consistency  
   * Cross-provider integration is simplified by non-overlapping CIDRs
* **GCP**: Each account gets dedicated VPC networks in each region  
   * Subnets are created per region (not per AZ since GCP uses a different availability model)

#### Key Takeaways

* Using different base CIDRs for different cloud providers simplifies firewall rules
* Subnet-specific prefix lengths allow efficient use of IP space (larger subnets for workloads requiring more IPs)
* Hierarchical approach makes it easy to add new regions later

### Startup Scaling from Single to Multi-Region

#### Challenge

A fast-growing SaaS startup initially deployed their application in a single AWS region (us-west-2). As they expand internationally, they need to:

* Deploy to 3 additional regions (us-east-1, eu-west-1, ap-southeast-1)
* Maintain existing IP allocations in us-west-2 to avoid disruption
* Allow for future expansion to more regions
* Support different subnet sizes based on workload requirements

#### Solution

The startup could use Subnetter to create an expandable allocation plan:

```json
{
  "baseCidr": "10.0.0.0/16",
  "prefixLengths": {
    "account": 16,
    "region": 19,
    "az": 21
  },
  "cloudProviders": ["aws"],
  "accounts": [
    {
      "name": "production",
      "clouds": {
        "aws": {
          "regions": ["us-west-2", "us-east-1", "eu-west-1", "ap-southeast-1"]
        }
      }
    }
  ],
  "subnetTypes": {
    "Public": 24,
    "Application": 22,
    "Database": 25,
    "Cache": 26,
    "Management": 27
  }
}
```

#### Expansion Strategy

This allocation enables:

1. **Preserving Existing Allocations**: The first CIDRs allocated will match their existing us-west-2 allocations
2. **Region-Specific Allocations**: Each region gets a clear CIDR block:
   * us-west-2: 10.0.0.0/19
   * us-east-1: 10.0.32.0/19
   * eu-west-1: 10.0.64.0/19
   * ap-southeast-1: 10.0.96.0/19
3. **Additional Future Regions**: Space for 4 more regions is reserved
4. **Workload-Appropriate Subnets**: Larger subnets (/22) for application tier, smaller subnets for specialized workloads

#### Key Takeaways

* Using a structured allocation approach allows for predictable expansion
* Workload-specific subnet sizes optimize IP allocation
* Clear documentation helps prevent IP conflicts as the environment grows

### Financial Services Compliance

#### Challenge

A financial services organization needs to implement cloud networking that meets stringent regulatory requirements:

* Complete network isolation between different banking functions
* Auditable boundaries between environment tiers
* Multi-layer security zones with varying security levels
* Comprehensive logging and monitoring
* Support for both AWS and Azure (multi-cloud strategy)

#### Solution

The organization could use Subnetter to implement a compliant architecture:

```json
{
  "baseCidr": "10.0.0.0/8",
  "prefixLengths": {
    "account": 16,
    "region": 20,
    "az": 22
  },
  "cloudProviders": ["aws", "azure"],
  "accounts": [
    {
      "name": "finance-shared-services",
      "clouds": {
        "aws": {
          "baseCidr": "10.1.0.0/16",
          "regions": ["us-east-1", "us-west-2", "eu-west-1", "ap-southeast-1"]
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "finance-retail-banking",
      "clouds": {
        "aws": {
          "baseCidr": "10.2.0.0/16",
          "regions": ["us-east-1", "us-west-2", "eu-west-1"]
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "finance-investment",
      "clouds": {
        "aws": {
          "baseCidr": "10.3.0.0/16",
          "regions": ["us-east-1", "us-west-2"]
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "finance-insurance",
      "clouds": {
        "azure": {
          "regions": ["eastus", "westeurope"]
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "finance-analytics",
      "clouds": {
        "gcp": {
          "regions": ["us-central1", "europe-west1"]
        }
      }
    }
  ],
  "subnetTypes": {
    "DMZ": 24,
    "Presentation": 24,
    "Application": 23,
    "Data": 25,
    "HighSecurity": 26,
    "Management": 28,
    "Audit": 27
  }
}
```

#### Security Architecture

This allocation enables a security architecture with:

1. **Account-Level Isolation**: Each banking function gets its own dedicated account
2. **Regional Compliance**: Different regions for different regulatory jurisdictions
3. **Security Zones**: Multiple subnet tiers with different security postures
   * DMZ zone: Internet-facing services with tightly controlled access
   * Presentation tier: Web applications with carefully restricted connectivity
   * Application tier: Business logic with no direct external access
   * Data tier: Databases with strictly limited connectivity
   * High-security zone: Sensitive systems with highly restricted access
4. **Audit Infrastructure**: Dedicated subnets for logging, monitoring, and audit systems

#### Key Takeaways

* Account-level isolation provides strong security boundaries
* Different subnet types enable appropriate security controls for each tier
* Multi-cloud strategy allows for provider-specific compliance features
* Clear IP boundaries facilitate audit and documentation

### Hybrid Cloud Implementation

#### Challenge

A media production company plans to implement a hybrid cloud architecture that spans their on-premises data centers and multiple cloud providers. They require:

* Seamless connectivity between on-premises and cloud resources
* Consistent IP addressing across all environments
* Separate address spaces for different workload types
* Support for AWS and Azure as primary cloud providers
* Reserved space for GCP expansion in the future

#### Solution

The company could use Subnetter to create a comprehensive hybrid architecture:

```json
{
  "baseCidr": "10.0.0.0/8",
  "prefixLengths": {
    "account": 16,
    "region": 20,
    "az": 22
  },
  "cloudProviders": ["aws", "azure", "gcp"],
  "accounts": [
    {
      "name": "on-premises",
      "clouds": {

#### Integration Architecture

This allocation enables:

1. **Consistent Addressing**: The same IP structure is used across on-premises and cloud environments
2. **Workload-Specific Allocations**: Different subnet types for different media workloads:
   * Media Ingest: For receiving raw content from cameras and production systems
   * Media Processing: Larger subnets (/22) for compute-intensive rendering and processing
   * Media Delivery: For content distribution infrastructure
   * Media Archive: For long-term storage systems
3. **Shared Services**: Common services that span environments
4. **Management Infrastructure**: Dedicated management plane for operations

#### Network Integration

* Direct Connect/ExpressRoute circuits connect on-premises and cloud environments
* VPN tunnels provide secure backup connectivity
* Consistent routing tables across all environments
* Shared services accessible from all environments

#### Key Takeaways

* Consistent addressing simplifies network integration
* Workload-specific subnet sizing optimizes IP allocation
* Reserved space for future expansion supports business growth

### Mergers and Acquisitions

#### Challenge

A large technology conglomerate regularly acquires smaller companies and needs to integrate them into its cloud infrastructure. The challenges include:

* Dealing with overlapping IP address spaces
* Standardizing network architecture across acquired companies
* Maintaining temporary isolation during migration
* Supporting both AWS and Azure environments
* Planning for future acquisitions

#### Solution

The conglomerate could use Subnetter to implement an acquisition-friendly architecture:

```json
{
  "baseCidr": "10.0.0.0/8",
  "prefixLengths": {
    "account": 16,
    "region": 20,
    "az": 22
  },
  "cloudProviders": ["aws", "azure", "gcp"],
  "accounts": [
    {
      "name": "parent-company",
      "clouds": {
        "aws": {
          "baseCidr": "10.0.0.0/12",
          "regions": ["us-east-1", "us-west-2", "eu-west-1", "ap-southeast-1"]
        },
        "azure": {
          "baseCidr": "10.16.0.0/12",
          "regions": ["eastus", "westeurope", "southeastasia"]
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "acquisition-1",
      "clouds": {
        "aws": {
          "baseCidr": "10.32.0.0/16",
          "regions": ["us-east-1", "eu-west-1"]
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "acquisition-2",
      "clouds": {
        "azure": {
          "baseCidr": "10.33.0.0/16",
          "regions": ["eastus", "westeurope"]
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "future-acquisitions",
      "clouds": {
        "aws": {
          "baseCidr": "10.34.0.0/14",
          "regions": []
        },
        "azure": {
          "baseCidr": "10.38.0.0/14",
          "regions": []
        }
      }
    }
  ],
  "subnetTypes": {
    "Public": 24,
    "AppTier": 23,
    "DataTier": 24,
    "SharedServices": 25,
    "Management": 26,
    "Migration": 24
  }
}
```

#### Acquisition Integration Strategy

This allocation enables:

1. **Parent Company Infrastructure**: Large allocations for the parent company's established resources
2. **Acquisition-Specific Spaces**: Dedicated address spaces for each acquisition
3. **Reserved Future Space**: Pre-allocated space for future acquisitions
4. **Migration Subnets**: Dedicated subnets for migration activities
5. **Multi-Cloud Support**: Consistent addressing across AWS and Azure resources

#### Migration Process

For each acquisition:
1. Allocate dedicated CIDR ranges using Subnetter
2. Set up temporary connectivity between acquired resources and parent infrastructure
3. Gradually migrate services to standardized architecture
4. Reallocate address space as needed for efficiency

#### Key Takeaways

* Reserved address blocks prevent fragmentation during acquisitions
* Standardized subnet types enforce architectural consistency
* Migration-specific subnets facilitate orderly transitions

## Understanding CIDR Allocation

### How the Allocation Algorithm Works

Subnetter uses a sophisticated, deterministic algorithm for allocating CIDR blocks. Understanding how this algorithm works will help you design your network architecture more effectively.

#### Hierarchical Allocation

The allocation process follows a strict hierarchy:

1. **Base CIDR**: The starting point for all allocations (e.g., `10.0.0.0/8`)
2. **Account Level**: Each account gets a portion of the base CIDR
3. **Region Level**: Each region gets a portion of its account's CIDR
4. **Availability Zone Level**: Each AZ gets a portion of its region's CIDR
5. **Subnet Level**: Each subnet type gets a portion of its AZ's CIDR

This hierarchical approach ensures that:
- Related resources are grouped together in the IP address space
- No overlaps occur between different parts of the hierarchy
- The allocation is deterministic and reproducible

#### Contiguous Allocation

At each level of the hierarchy, the allocation is performed contiguously. This means:

1. Blocks are allocated sequentially from the available space
2. Each new allocation starts immediately after the previous one
3. There are no gaps between allocations at the same level

For example, if you allocate a `/16` block for each account, they would be allocated as:
- Account 1: `10.0.0.0/16`
- Account 2: `10.1.0.0/16`
- Account 3: `10.2.0.0/16`

And so on.

### Customizing the Allocation Process

You can influence how the allocation works through several configuration options:

#### Prefix Lengths

The `prefixLengths` option lets you control the size of blocks allocated at each level:

```json
{
  "prefixLengths": {
    "account": 16,  // Each account gets a /16 (65,536 IPs)
    "region": 20,   // Each region gets a /20 (4,096 IPs)
    "az": 24        // Each AZ gets a /24 (256 IPs)
  }
}
```

Larger prefix numbers mean smaller blocks. For optimal allocation:
- Account prefix should be larger than the base CIDR prefix (e.g., `/16` for a `/8` base)
- Region prefix should be larger than account prefix (e.g., `/20` for `/16` accounts)
- AZ prefix should be larger than region prefix (e.g., `/24` for `/20` regions)

#### CIDR Overrides

You can override the allocation at various levels:

1. **Account Overrides**: Specify a `baseCidr` for an entire account
   ```json
   {
     "name": "production",
     "clouds": {
       "aws": {
         "provider": "aws",
         "baseCidr": "10.100.0.0/16"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Provider Overrides**: Use different address spaces for different cloud providers
   ```json
   {
     "name": "hybrid",
     "clouds": {
       "aws": {
         "provider": "aws",
         "baseCidr": "10.0.0.0/16"
       },
       "azure": {
         "provider": "azure",
         "baseCidr": "172.16.0.0/16"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. **CLI Overrides**: Override the base CIDR for all allocations
   ```bash
   subnetter generate -c config.json -b 192.168.0.0/16
   ```

### Space Utilization

Subnetter calculates the required space for each level of the hierarchy based on:
1. **Number of accounts**: Determines total accounts space needed
2. **Regions per account**: Determines per-account space needed
3. **AZs per region**: Determines per-region space needed
4. **Subnet types**: Determines per-AZ space needed

The tool will check if there's enough space for all allocations and provide clear error messages if not.

Example error:
```
[ERROR] [CLI] ❌ Error: [3002] Not enough space left for allocation with prefix /20
[INFO] [CLI] 💡 Help: Your CIDR block is too small for the requested allocation. Use a larger CIDR block or reduce the number of subnets.
```

### Handling IP Space Constraints

If you encounter space limitations, you have several options:

1. **Use a larger base CIDR**: Change from `10.0.0.0/8` to `0.0.0.0/0` to use the entire IPv4 space
2. **Reduce the number of regions**: Consolidate regions to reduce address space needs
3. **Use larger subnet prefixes**: Use `/27` instead of `/24` to create smaller subnets
4. **Override specific accounts**: Use custom CIDRs for accounts that need more space
5. **Split by provider**: Use different address spaces for different cloud providers

### Real-World Allocation Examples

#### Small Deployment (1 account, 2 regions, 3 subnets)

```json
{
  "baseCidr": "10.0.0.0/16",  // Smaller base for a small deployment
  "prefixLengths": {
    "account": 16,  // Single account gets the entire /16
    "region": 20,   // Each region gets a /20
    "az": 24        // Each AZ gets a /24
  },
  "accounts": [
    {
      "name": "startup",
      "clouds": {
        "aws": {
          "provider": "aws",
          "regions": ["us-east-1", "us-west-2"]
        }
      }
    }
  ],
  "subnetTypes": {
    "Public": 26,
    "Private": 26,
    "Database": 26
  }
}
```

Resulting allocations (simplified):
```
startup/aws/us-east-1/az-a/Public:   10.0.0.0/26
startup/aws/us-east-1/az-a/Private:  10.0.0.64/26
startup/aws/us-east-1/az-a/Database: 10.0.0.128/26
startup/aws/us-east-1/az-b/Public:   10.0.1.0/26
// ... and so on
```

#### Large Enterprise (4 accounts, multiple regions, custom overrides)

```json
{
  "baseCidr": "10.0.0.0/8",
  "prefixLengths": {
    "account": 16,
    "region": 20,
    "az": 24
  },
  "accounts": [
    {
      "name": "production",
      "clouds": {
        "aws": {
          "provider": "aws",
          "baseCidr": "10.100.0.0/16",
          "regions": ["us-east-1", "us-west-2", "eu-west-1", "ap-southeast-1"]
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "staging",
      "clouds": {
        "aws": {
          "provider": "aws",
          "baseCidr": "10.101.0.0/16",
          "regions": ["us-east-1", "eu-west-1"]
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "development",
      "clouds": {
        "aws": {
          "provider": "aws",
          "baseCidr": "10.102.0.0/16",
          "regions": ["us-east-1"]
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "tools",
      "clouds": {
        "aws": {
          "provider": "aws",
          "baseCidr": "10.103.0.0/16",
          "regions": ["us-east-1"]
        }
      }
    }
  ],
  "subnetTypes": {
    "Public": 26,
    "PrivateWebTier": 25,
    "PrivateAppTier": 24,
    "PrivateDataTier": 26,
    "Management": 27
  }
}
```

This configuration demonstrates how to use custom CIDR overrides to provide dedicated address spaces for each account with adequate space for multiple regions and subnet types.
