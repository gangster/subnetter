## IP Addressing Basics

### IPv4 Address Structure

An IPv4 address is a 32-bit number represented in dotted-decimal notation, divided into four 8-bit octets:

```
192.168.1.1
```

Each octet can range from 0 to 255, giving a total of approximately 4.3 billion possible IPv4 addresses.

### Network and Host Portions

IP addresses are divided into two logical parts:
- **Network portion**: Identifies the network
- **Host portion**: Identifies a specific device on that network

The division between these portions is determined by the subnet mask or prefix length.

### Traditional Subnet Masks

Before CIDR, subnet masks were expressed in dotted-decimal notation:

| Class | Subnet Mask    | Networks | Hosts per Network |
|-------|----------------|----------|-------------------|
| A     | 255.0.0.0      | 128      | 16,777,214        |
| B     | 255.255.0.0    | 16,384   | 65,534            |
| C     | 255.255.255.0  | 2,097,152| 254               |

This class-based system was inflexible and led to inefficient use of IP address space.

## CIDR Notation

### What is CIDR?

CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) notation is a compact method for specifying IP address ranges that replaced the older class-based system.

### CIDR Format

A CIDR block is represented as:

```
<IP address>/<prefix length>
```

For example: `10.0.0.0/8`

The prefix length (1-32) indicates how many bits of the IP address are fixed (the network portion), with the remaining bits available for hosts.

### Prefix Length and Available Addresses

| Prefix Length | Available Addresses | Common Use Case           |
|---------------|---------------------|---------------------------|
| /8            | 16,777,216          | Entire organization       |
| /16           | 65,536              | Large data center         |
| /20           | 4,096               | Cloud account or region   |
| /22           | 1,024               | Availability zone         |
| /24           | 256                 | Standard subnet           |
| /26           | 64                  | Small subnet              |
| /28           | 16                  | Micro subnet              |
| /30           | 4                   | Point-to-point link       |
| /31           | 2                   | Point-to-point (RFC 3021) |
| /32           | 1                   | Single host               |

**Formula**: Available addresses = 2^(32 - prefix length)

### Usable IP Addresses

In most networks, the first and last IP addresses in a subnet are reserved:
- First address: Network address
- Last address: Broadcast address

Therefore, the number of usable IP addresses is typically 2 fewer than the total:

**Usable IPs** = 2^(32 - prefix length) - 2

For example, a /24 subnet has 256 total addresses but 254 usable IPs.

**Exception**: In /31 networks (RFC 3021), both addresses can be used for point-to-point links.

## Subnet Sizing and Planning

### Determining Subnet Size

When planning your network, consider:

1. **Current needs**: How many hosts do you need to support now?
2. **Future growth**: How much expansion do you anticipate?
3. **Network segmentation**: How do you want to divide your network logically?
4. **Address utilization**: What is an acceptable utilization percentage?

### Subnet Size Calculation

To determine the prefix length needed for a specific number of hosts:

1. Calculate the number of bits needed: log₂(number of hosts + 2)
2. Round up to the next whole number
3. Subtract from 32 to get the prefix length

**Example**: For 100 hosts, you need log₂(102) ≈ 6.67 bits, rounded up to 7 bits.
Prefix length = 32 - 7 = /25, which provides 128 addresses (126 usable).

### Subnet Boundaries

CIDR blocks must start at addresses that are multiples of their size.

**Example**: Valid /24 subnets include 10.0.0.0/24, 10.0.1.0/24, 10.0.2.0/24, etc.

### Subnet Visualization

Here's a visual representation of how a /24 subnet divides into smaller subnets:

```
10.0.0.0/24 (256 addresses)
│
├── 10.0.0.0/25 (128 addresses)
│   │
│   ├── 10.0.0.0/26 (64 addresses)
│   │   │
│   │   ├── 10.0.0.0/27 (32 addresses)
│   │   └── 10.0.0.32/27 (32 addresses)
│   │
│   └── 10.0.0.64/26 (64 addresses)
│       │
│       ├── 10.0.0.64/27 (32 addresses)
│       └── 10.0.0.96/27 (32 addresses)
│
└── 10.0.0.128/25 (128 addresses)
    │
    ├── 10.0.0.128/26 (64 addresses)
    │   │
    │   ├── 10.0.0.128/27 (32 addresses)
    │   └── 10.0.0.160/27 (32 addresses)
    │
    └── 10.0.0.192/26 (64 addresses)
        │
        ├── 10.0.0.192/27 (32 addresses)
        └── 10.0.0.224/27 (32 addresses)
```

This visual helps understand how subnets are hierarchically subdivided, with each level doubling the number of subnets while halving their size.

## Hierarchical Allocation

Hierarchical IP allocation is a strategic approach to subnet design that creates a tree-like structure of network segments. This hierarchical model makes address management more scalable and helps prevent overlaps.

### Example: Subnetting a CIDR Block

When you have a base CIDR block like `10.0.0.0/16`, you can divide it into increasingly smaller subnets:

```
10.0.0.0/16 (65,536 addresses)
├── 10.0.0.0/17 (32,768 addresses)
│   ├── 10.0.0.0/18 (16,384 addresses)
│   └── 10.0.64.0/18 (16,384 addresses)
└── 10.0.128.0/17 (32,768 addresses)
    ├── 10.0.128.0/18 (16,384 addresses)
    └── 10.0.192.0/18 (16,384 addresses)
```

### Hierarchical Design Approach

For cloud environments, a common hierarchical design might look like:

```
Base CIDR
├── Account 1
│   ├── Region 1
│   │   ├── VPC 1
│   │   │   ├── Subnet 1
│   │   │   └── Subnet 2
│   │   └── VPC 2
│   └── Region 2
└── Account 2
```

For Kubernetes deployments specifically, we recommend checking our detailed [Kubernetes Network Design](./guides/kubernetes-network-design/) guide, which provides a comprehensive approach to designing multi-AZ Kubernetes networks with optimized subnet sizing for high availability and efficient IP utilization.

### Real-World Example

In a multi-account AWS architecture, we might allocate:

- `/12` for the entire organization
- `/16` for each account
- `/20` for each region within an account
- `/22` or `/23` for each VPC
- `/24` or `/25` for individual subnets

This approach ensures adequate space at each level while preventing overlaps. By ensuring that different parts of your infrastructure use different, non-overlapping CIDRs, you facilitate future connectivity options like VPC peering, transit gateways, or direct connections.

### Prefix Length Progression

In a hierarchical design, each level uses a larger prefix length (smaller subnet):

| Level    | Example Prefix | Addresses per Block |
|----------|---------------|---------------------|
| Base     | /8            | 16,777,216          |
| Account  | /16           | 65,536              |
| Region   | /20           | 4,096               |
| AZ       | /22           | 1,024               |
| Subnet   | /24           | 256                 |

### Planning for Growth

When allocating CIDRs hierarchically, always consider future growth:

1. **Reserve space between allocations**: Leave gaps between accounts or regions
2. **Use larger blocks than currently needed**: Allocate for 2-3x your current size
3. **Balance depth and breadth**: Deeper hierarchies (more levels) give more flexibility
4. **Plan for multi-region expansion**: Reserve space for new regions even if you start with one

### Avoiding Common Pitfalls

When implementing hierarchical CIDR allocation, avoid these common mistakes:

1. **Starting too small**: Using a base CIDR that's too small (e.g., /16 instead of /8)
2. **Insufficient gaps between entities**: Not leaving room for growth between accounts or regions
3. **Inconsistent allocation patterns**: Using different patterns across accounts
4. **Ignoring cloud provider limits**: Not considering the subnet size limitations of each cloud
5. **Overlapping ranges**: Manually assigning ranges that overlap with existing allocations

## Cloud Provider Specifics

### AWS

- VPCs can use CIDR blocks from /16 to /28
- Subnets must be between /16 and /28
- First 4 IPs and last IP in each subnet are reserved:
  - Network address (first IP)
  - VPC router (second IP)
  - DNS server (third IP)
  - Future use (fourth IP)
  - Broadcast address (last IP)
- Minimum subnet size is /28 (16 addresses, 11 usable)

#### AWS-Specific Features

- **Private Service Connect**: Access Google services privately

#### GCP CIDR Best Practices

- Use a hierarchical IP address plan that aligns with your resource hierarchy
- Plan for expansion across regions with non-overlapping subnets
- Reserve address space for specialized networking features
- Consider future connectivity with on-premises networks

## Multi-Cloud Considerations

When allocating CIDRs across multiple cloud providers, consider these additional factors:

1. **Non-overlapping ranges between providers**: Ensure each cloud provider has a unique range
2. **Consistent allocation strategy**: Use the same hierarchical approach across all providers
3. **Connectivity requirements**: Plan for VPN or direct connect between clouds
4. **Transit routing**: Account for transit networks that connect multiple clouds
5. **Consistent documentation**: Maintain unified documentation across all environments

### Example Multi-Cloud Allocation

```
Enterprise: 10.0.0.0/8
│
├── AWS Environments: 10.0.0.0/12
│   ├── Development: 10.0.0.0/16
│   ├── Testing: 10.1.0.0/16
│   └── Production: 10.2.0.0/16
│
├── Azure Environments: 10.16.0.0/12
│   ├── Development: 10.16.0.0/16
│   ├── Testing: 10.17.0.0/16
│   └── Production: 10.18.0.0/16
│
└── GCP Environments: 10.32.0.0/12
    ├── Development: 10.32.0.0/16
    ├── Testing: 10.33.0.0/16
    └── Production: 10.34.0.0/16
```

This approach ensures clear separation between cloud providers while maintaining a consistent addressing scheme.

## CIDR Calculation Examples

### Subdividing a CIDR Block

To divide a /20 block into /22 blocks:

1. Calculate the number of subnets: 2^(22-20) = 2^2 = 4
2. Starting with 10.0.0.0/20:
   - Subnet 1: 10.0.0.0/22
   - Subnet 2: 10.0.4.0/22
   - Subnet 3: 10.0.8.0/22
   - Subnet 4: 10.0.12.0/22

### Working with Binary Representation

Understanding the binary representation helps grasp CIDR concepts:

**10.0.0.0/20 in binary**  
```
00001010.00000000.0000|0000.00000000
           Network (20 bits)  Host (12 bits)
```

**First /22 subnet (10.0.0.0/22)**  
```
00001010.00000000.0000 00|00.00000000
           Network (22 bits)  Host (10 bits)
```

**Second /22 subnet (10.0.4.0/22)**  
```
00001010.00000000.0000 01|00.00000000
                     ^^
           Network (22 bits)  Host (10 bits)
```

Notice how only the host portion of the original /20 changes when creating the /22 subnets.

### Calculating Subnet Boundaries

To find the start address of the nth /24 subnet within a /16 block:

1. Calculate the size of each subnet: 2^(24-16) = 2^8 = 256 addresses
2. Multiply n by the subnet size: n × 256
3. Add the result to the base address

**Example**: The 5th /24 subnet (n=4, zero-indexed) in 10.0.0.0/16:
- 10.0.0.0 + (4 × 256) = 10.0.4.0/24

### Checking for Overlaps

Two CIDRs overlap if one is a subset of the other or they share address space.

**Example 1**: 10.0.0.0/24 and 10.0.1.0/24
- These do NOT overlap (different /24 blocks)

**Example 2**: 10.0.0.0/24 and 10.0.0.0/25
- These DO overlap (the /25 is contained within the /24)

**Example 3**: 10.0.0.0/24 and 10.0.0.128/25
- These DO overlap (the second /25 is contained within the /24)

**Example 4**: 10.0.0.0/25 and 10.0.0.128/25
- These do NOT overlap (these are the two halves of a /24)

## Tools and Resources

- **Subnetter Tool**: Use this tool for automated, hierarchical CIDR allocation
- **IP Calculators**: Online tools like ipcalc.net for quick calculations
- **Visualization Tools**: Draw.io or similar tools for network diagrams
- **Cloud Documentation**: AWS, Azure, and GCP documentation on VPC/VNet addressing
- **RFCs**: RFC 1918 (Private Address Space), RFC 4632 (CIDR), RFC 3021 (/31 subnets)

## Practical Application of CIDR Allocation

### Hierarchical Allocation Strategy

When planning your network infrastructure, a hierarchical allocation strategy offers several advantages:

1. **Organization**: A clear hierarchy makes network documentation and troubleshooting easier
2. **Expandability**: Reserved space at each level allows for future growth
3. **Consistency**: Following patterns simplifies automation and validation

A typical hierarchy might look like:

```
Enterprise (10.0.0.0/8)
├── Business Unit A (10.0.0.0/12)
│   ├── Production (10.0.0.0/14)
│   │   ├── Region 1 (10.0.0.0/16)
│   │   ├── Region 2 (10.1.0.0/16)
│   │   └── ... 
│   ├── Staging (10.4.0.0/14)
│   └── ...
├── Business Unit B (10.16.0.0/12)
│   └── ...
└── ...
```

### Calculating Network Addresses and Broadcast Addresses

For any CIDR block, you can calculate:

- **Network Address**: The first address in the block (not usable for hosts)
- **Broadcast Address**: The last address in the block (not usable for hosts)
- **Usable Range**: All addresses between network and broadcast addresses

Example for `10.0.0.0/24`:
- Network address: `10.0.0.0`
- Broadcast address: `10.0.0.255`
- Usable range: `10.0.0.1` - `10.0.0.254`
- Total usable addresses: 254

### Subnet Sizing Best Practices

When deciding on subnet sizes, consider these guidelines:

1. **Plan for growth**: Allocate 2-3x your current needs where possible
2. **Consider special requirements**: IoT networks might need very large subnets, while security zones might be small
3. **Standardize where possible**: Use consistent sizes for similar workloads
4. **Avoid overly large subnets**: Balance growth needs with security boundaries
5. **Consider cloud provider limits**: Azure, AWS, and GCP have different subnet size limitations

#### Recommended Subnet Sizes for Common Use Cases:

| Subnet Type      | Typical Size | Usable IPs | Use Case                                |
|------------------|--------------|------------|----------------------------------------|
| Public           | /24 to /27   | 254 to 30  | Internet-facing load balancers, NAT gateways |
| Private Web Tier | /24 to /26   | 254 to 62  | Web servers, application frontends     |
| Private App Tier | /23 to /25   | 510 to 126 | Application servers, containers        |
| Data Tier        | /26 to /28   | 62 to 14   | Databases, caches                      |
| Management       | /27 to /29   | 30 to 6    | Jump servers, monitoring               |
| Transit          | /28 to /30   | 14 to 2    | VPN connections, transit gateways      |

### Avoiding Fragmentation with Contiguous Allocation

Contiguous allocation ensures that related subnets are allocated from adjacent address space. This brings several benefits:

1. **Simplified routing**: Related resources can often share route table entries
2. **Efficient ACLs**: Security rules can target larger CIDR blocks
3. **Future aggregation**: Adjacent blocks can be combined if needed

Example of contiguous allocation for regions within an account:

```
Account (10.0.0.0/16)
├── us-east-1 (10.0.0.0/20)
├── us-west-2 (10.0.16.0/20)
├── eu-west-1 (10.0.32.0/20)
└── ap-northeast-1 (10.0.48.0/20)
```

### Handling Multi-Cloud Environments

When allocating CIDRs across multiple cloud providers, you have two main strategies:

1. **Unified Address Space**: Use a single cohesive allocation scheme across all providers
   - Advantages: Simplicity, potential for cross-cloud connectivity
   - Challenges: Coordinating overlaps, different provider constraints

2. **Segmented Address Space**: Use different address ranges for each provider
   - Advantages: Independence, flexibility, isolation
   - Challenges: May require more NAT/translation at connection points

Example of segmented address space:

```
Enterprise
├── AWS (10.0.0.0/8)
│   └── ...
├── Azure (172.16.0.0/12)
│   └── ...
└── GCP (192.168.0.0/16)
    └── ...
```

### Address Utilization Calculations

To calculate how many addresses you need:

1. **For each account**: (Regions × AZs × Subnet Types) addresses
2. **Add buffer**: At least 20% for future growth
3. **Consider expansion**: Both horizontal (new regions) and vertical (new subnet types)

Example calculation for a company with:
- 3 accounts (prod, staging, dev)
- 3 regions per account
- 3 AZs per region
- 5 subnet types per AZ

Minimum addresses needed:
3 accounts × 3 regions × 3 AZs × 5 subnet types = 135 subnets

If each subnet is a /24 (256 addresses), that's 135 × 256 = 34,560 addresses.
With a 20% buffer: 41,472 addresses (which fits in a /15 CIDR).

### Real-World Applications

#### Cloud Migration Strategy

When migrating to the cloud, you can use CIDR allocation to plan your migration phases:

1. **Current On-Premises**: Document existing CIDR allocations
2. **Transition Phase**: Allocate non-overlapping CIDRs for cloud resources
3. **Future State**: Plan for expanded cloud footprint

Example:
```
Current: On-Premises (10.0.0.0/16)
Phase 1: AWS Initial Migration (10.1.0.0/16)
Phase 2: AWS Expanded Workloads (10.2.0.0/16)
Phase 3: Multi-Cloud Expansion - Azure (172.16.0.0/16)
```

#### Enterprise Multi-Region Architecture

For a global enterprise with regional deployments:

```
Enterprise (10.0.0.0/8)
├── Production (10.0.0.0/11)
│   ├── Americas
│   │   ├── us-east-1 (10.0.0.0/16)
│   │   │   ├── AZ-a (10.0.0.0/20)
│   │   │   │   ├── Public (10.0.0.0/24)
│   │   │   │   ├── PrivateWeb (10.0.1.0/24)
│   │   │   │   ├── PrivateApp (10.0.2.0/23)
│   │   │   │   └── PrivateData (10.0.4.0/24)
│   │   │   ├── AZ-b (10.0.16.0/20)
│   │   │   │   └── ...
│   │   │   └── AZ-c (10.0.32.0/20)
│   │   │       └── ...
│   │   └── us-west-2 (10.1.0.0/16)
│   │       └── ...
│   ├── EMEA
│   │   ├── eu-west-1 (10.2.0.0/16)
│   │   └── ...
│   └── APAC
│       ├── ap-southeast-1 (10.3.0.0/16)
│       └── ...
├── Non-Production (10.32.0.0/11)
│   ├── Staging (10.32.0.0/12)
│   └── Development (10.48.0.0/12)
└── Shared Services (10.64.0.0/11)
    ├── Management (10.64.0.0/12)
    ├── Security (10.80.0.0/12)
    └── Transit (10.96.0.0/12)
```

This hierarchical approach ensures that there's room for growth at each level, while keeping related resources grouped together.
