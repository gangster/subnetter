## The Problem

Every cloud network starts with a simple question: *"What IP addresses should we use?"*

What seems straightforward quickly becomes a nightmare at scale. A typical enterprise cloud deployment requires:

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Exponential Complexity" icon="warning">
**12 accounts** × **4 regions** × **3 AZs** × **6 subnet types** = **864 unique subnets**

Each one needs a carefully calculated CIDR block. One overlap, and traffic routes to the wrong place—or nowhere at all.
  </Card>
  <Card title="The Spreadsheet Trap" icon="document">
Teams resort to massive spreadsheets. Formulas break. Rows get deleted. Version control is "final_v3_REAL.xlsx". The person who built it left the company.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Growth Breaks Everything" icon="error">
You allocated a /24 for production. Now you need 500 hosts. Re-IP the entire VPC? Migrate workloads? Explain to leadership why this "simple change" takes 3 months?
  </Card>
  <Card title="Multi-Cloud Multiplies Pain" icon="puzzle">
AWS uses `us-east-1a`. Azure uses `eastus-1`. GCP uses `us-central1-a`. Three clouds means three naming conventions, three spreadsheets, and three times the chance for human error.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

### The Hidden Costs

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="🔥 Incident Response" icon="error">
**Hours to days per incident**

A developer deploys to staging, but traffic routes to production. Why? Overlapping CIDRs between VPCs. The on-call engineer spends 3am tracing packet flows, comparing subnet tables, and explaining to leadership why customer data might have been exposed.
  </Card>
  <Card title="🏗️ Re-IP Projects" icon="warning">
**Weeks to months of engineering time**

You allocated a /24 for the data tier. Now the ML team needs 500 GPU instances. Options: re-architect the entire VPC, migrate every workload with downtime, or run a parallel network and maintain both. None are good. All are expensive.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="🧠 Tribal Knowledge" icon="information">
**Institutional risk**

"Why is this subnet 10.47.128.0/22?" The answer lives in Sarah's head. Sarah left 6 months ago. The wiki says "see network diagram" but the diagram is from 2019. New engineers take weeks to become productive because the network is a mystery.
  </Card>
  <Card title="📋 Compliance & Audits" icon="document">
**Failed audits, delayed certifications**

The auditor asks: "Show me your IP address management policy." You show them a spreadsheet. They ask: "How do you prevent overlaps?" You say: "We're careful." They write: "Finding: No automated controls for IP allocation. Risk: High."
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="🤝 M&A Integration" icon="puzzle">
**Months of delay, millions in cost**

Your company acquires a competitor. Their production network is 10.0.0.0/8. So is yours. Every integration project—shared services, data migration, unified auth—is blocked until someone re-IPs an entire organization. The deal synergies are delayed by a year.
  </Card>
  <Card title="📈 Scaling Paralysis" icon="rocket">
**Opportunity cost**

The business wants to launch in 3 new regions by Q2. The network team says: "We need to plan the IP allocation first." Planning takes 6 weeks. Implementation takes 4 more. The competitor launches first. The window closes.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

### There's a Better Way

What if you could describe your entire network structure in a simple config file—and generate every subnet allocation automatically, with mathematical guarantees of zero conflicts?

**That's Subnetter.**

Define your accounts, regions, and subnet types once. Subnetter handles the CIDR math, respects cloud provider conventions, and produces a complete allocation table in seconds. Add a new region? One line in the config. Need to audit your IP space? It's all in version control.

| development | azure | westeurope | westeurope-3 | Management | 10.2.28.64/28 |

**3 accounts × 6 regions × 3 AZs × 4 subnets = 144 allocations**
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

<Aside type="note" title="Zero Conflicts Guaranteed">
Every CIDR is mathematically guaranteed to be non-overlapping. The hierarchical allocation algorithm ensures each account, region, AZ, and subnet gets its own dedicated slice of IP space.

## Real-World Scenarios

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="🏢 Enterprise">
**Scenario:** Global financial services company migrating to cloud

- 50+ AWS accounts (prod, staging, dev, sandbox per business unit)
- 8 regions for data residency compliance
- 6 subnet types per VPC (public, private, data, management, endpoints, transit)
- Strict audit requirements for IP allocation

**Without Subnetter:** 6-month planning project. Dedicated network team. Custom tooling.

**With Subnetter:** Single config file. Version-controlled. Auditable. Done in a day.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="🚀 Startup">
**Scenario:** Fast-growing SaaS company expanding internationally

- Started with 1 region, now need 5
- Adding new microservices weekly
- Can't afford downtime for re-IP projects
- Small team wearing many hats

**Without Subnetter:** Outgrow your IP scheme. Painful re-architecture. Production incidents.

**With Subnetter:** Plan for 10x growth upfront. Add regions in minutes. Sleep at night.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="☁️ Multi-Cloud">
**Scenario:** Healthcare company with multi-cloud strategy

- AWS for compute, Azure for AI/ML, GCP for analytics
- Need consistent IP strategy across all three
- Each cloud has different AZ naming conventions
- Compliance requires documented network architecture

**Without Subnetter:** Three different spreadsheets. Manual translation. Inevitable conflicts.

**With Subnetter:** One config. All clouds. Provider-aware AZ naming. Single source of truth.

## How It Works

Subnetter divides your IP space hierarchically—no overlaps, guaranteed:

## The Manual Approach vs. Subnetter

| Aspect | Manual (Spreadsheets) | Subnetter |
|--------|----------------------|-----------|
| **Time to plan 100 subnets** | Hours to days | Seconds |
| **Risk of overlap** | High (human error) | Zero (algorithmic) |
| **Adding a new region** | Recalculate everything | Add one line to config |
| **Multi-cloud consistency** | Three separate docs | One unified config |
| **Onboarding new team members** | "Ask Sarah, she knows" | Self-documenting config |
| **Disaster recovery** | Hope the spreadsheet is current | Regenerate from Git |
| **Audit trail** | "Check the wiki" | Git history |
