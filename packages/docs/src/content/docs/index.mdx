## Try It Now

Get your first allocation in under a minute:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="npm">
```bash
# Install and run
npm install -g subnetter
subnetter generate --config config.json --output allocations.csv
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="npx (no install)">
```bash
# Run directly without installing
npx subnetter generate --config config.json --output allocations.csv
```
  </TabItem>

## See It In Action

**Input:** A simple configuration file describing your cloud structure

```json
{
  "baseCidr": "10.0.0.0/16",
  "accounts": [{
    "name": "production",
    "clouds": {
      "aws": { "regions": ["us-east-1", "us-west-2"] }
    }
  }],
  "subnetTypes": { "Public": 24, "Private": 24, "Data": 26 }
}
```

**Output:** Complete, conflict-free subnet allocations

| Account | Region | AZ | Subnet | CIDR | Usable IPs |
|---------|--------|-----|--------|------|------------|
| production | us-east-1 | us-east-1a | Public | 10.0.0.0/24 | 254 |
| production | us-east-1 | us-east-1a | Private | 10.0.1.0/24 | 254 |
| production | us-east-1 | us-east-1a | Data | 10.0.2.0/26 | 62 |
| production | us-east-1 | us-east-1b | Public | 10.0.4.0/24 | 254 |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

No overlaps. No conflicts. Every time.

## Why Subnetter?

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Stop Wrestling with Spreadsheets" icon="document">
    Manual IP planning across accounts, regions, and AZs is tedious and error-prone. One wrong entry means hours of debugging connectivity issues.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Scale Without Re-IP Projects" icon="rocket">
    Poor upfront planning leads to painful re-addressing as you grow. Subnetter's hierarchical approach reserves space for future expansion.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Multi-Cloud, One Strategy" icon="puzzle">
    AWS, Azure, GCP—each has different conventions. Subnetter handles provider-specific naming while maintaining a unified allocation strategy.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Infrastructure as Code Ready" icon="setting">
    Export to CSV and integrate with Terraform, CloudFormation, or any IaC tool. Your network config becomes version-controlled and reproducible.

## How It Works

Subnetter divides your IP space hierarchically—no overlaps, guaranteed:

<MermaidDiagram chart={`
flowchart LR
    A["🌐 Base CIDR<br/>10.0.0.0/8"] --> B["☁️ Accounts<br/>/16 each"]
    B --> C["🗺️ Regions<br/>/20 each"]
    C --> D["📍 AZs<br/>/22 each"]
    D --> E["🔲 Subnets<br/>/24-/28"]
    
    style A fill:#1a1a2e,color:#fff,stroke:#4a4a6a,stroke-width:2px
    style B fill:#16213e,color:#fff,stroke:#4a4a6a,stroke-width:2px
    style C fill:#0f3460,color:#fff,stroke:#4a4a6a,stroke-width:2px
    style D fill:#1a5276,color:#fff,stroke:#4a4a6a,stroke-width:2px
    style E fill:#1e8449,color:#fff,stroke:#4a4a6a,stroke-width:2px
`} />

Each level gets a dedicated, non-overlapping slice of your IP space. Add new accounts or regions anytime—Subnetter ensures they never conflict with existing allocations.
