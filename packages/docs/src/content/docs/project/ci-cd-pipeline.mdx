This document describes the Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for the Subnetter project, including workflows, processes, and tools.

## Overview

The Subnetter project implements a robust CI/CD pipeline consisting of several GitHub Actions workflows:

1. **CI/CD Workflow** - Tests code, creates releases, and publishes packages when code is merged to main
2. **Pull Request Validation** - Validates code changes in pull requests before merging
3. **Documentation Publishing** - Deploys documentation to GitHub Pages

The pipelines are designed to ensure code quality, maintain test coverage, and automate the release process.

## CI/CD Workflow

The main CI/CD workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` and handles testing, building, and releasing the project when changes are pushed to the main branch or when pull requests are created.

### CI/CD Workflow Jobs

The workflow includes the following jobs:

1. **Validate PR** (only on pull requests):
   - Checks that package-lock.json is not committed (Yarn-only project)
   - Sets up Node.js
   - Configures Yarn Berry
   - Installs dependencies
   - Lints commit messages

2. **Test PR** (only on pull requests):
   - Sets up Node.js
   - Configures Yarn Berry
   - Installs dependencies
   - Runs linting checks
   - Builds the project with the correct order (cidr-utils → core → cli)
   - Runs unit tests
   - Runs end-to-end tests

3. **Test Main Branch** (only on push to main):
   - Similar to Test PR but runs when changes are pushed to main

4. **Check If Release Needed**:
   - Determines if a release is needed based on commit messages
   - Uses conventional commits to identify changes that would trigger a release

5. **Release** (if needed):
   - Sets up Node.js
   - Configures Yarn Berry
   - Configures Git for automated commits
   - Installs dependencies
   - Builds the project
   - Runs the semantic-release process

## Build Process

The CI/CD workflow builds packages in a specific order to ensure proper dependency resolution:

1. Build `@subnetter/cidr-utils` first (foundation package)
2. Build `@subnetter/core` second (depends on cidr-utils)
3. Build `@subnetter/cli` last (depends on core)

This build order is explicitly defined in the workflow to prevent module resolution issues:

```yaml
- name: Build
  run: |
    yarn build:cidr-utils
    yarn build:core
    yarn build:cli
```

## Dependencies and Configuration

The CI/CD pipeline has been optimized to remove unnecessary dependencies and configurations:

- **No System Dependencies**: The pipeline does not require any specialized system dependencies as the project uses pure JavaScript/TypeScript
- **Simplified Configuration**: No custom `.npmrc` configuration is needed
- **Yarn Berry**: Uses Yarn Berry's zero-install features for improved dependency management

## Pull Request Validation

Pull requests are validated through a series of checks to ensure they meet quality standards before being merged:

1. **Package-lock.json Check**: Ensures no package-lock.json files are committed (Yarn-only project)
2. **Commit Message Linting**: Validates that commit messages follow the conventional commits format
3. **Code Quality**: Runs linting checks to ensure code style and quality standards
4. **Tests**: Runs unit tests and end-to-end tests to ensure functionality

## Documentation Publishing

The Documentation Publishing workflow automatically builds and deploys the documentation site to GitHub Pages when documentation files are changed or on manual triggers.

### Documentation Publishing Process

1. **Build the TypeScript Projects**: Builds all packages with proper order (cidr-utils → core → cli)
2. **Build the Documentation Site**: Builds the Astro documentation site
3. **Deploy to GitHub Pages**: Deploys the documentation to GitHub Pages

## Release Process

The release process is automated and follows semantic versioning principles:

1. **Version Determination**:
   - **Patch version** (1.0.x): For bug fixes (`fix:` commits)
   - **Minor version** (1.x.0): For new features (`feat:` commits)
   - **Major version** (x.0.0): For breaking changes (`feat!:`, `fix!:`, or `BREAKING CHANGE:` in commit body)

2. **Release Creation**:
   - Updates version numbers
   - Generates release notes
   - Updates the changelog
   - Creates a GitHub release
   - Tags the repository

3. **Package Publishing**:
   - Publishes packages to npm or GitHub Packages
   - Follows the dependency order (cidr-utils → core → cli)

## Workflow Dependencies

The CI/CD workflow has been optimized to ensure efficient execution:

1. **Workspace Dependencies**: Uses the `"workspace:^"` syntax in package.json files to ensure proper linking between packages
2. **Caching**: Caches Yarn dependencies for faster builds
3. **Concurrency Control**: Uses concurrency settings to prevent simultaneous releases

## Local Development and CI Consistency

When developing locally, you can run the same checks that will be performed in the CI pipeline:

```bash
# Build all packages in the correct order
yarn build

# Build individual packages
yarn build:cidr-utils
yarn build:core
yarn build:cli

# Run linting
yarn lint

# Run tests
yarn test

# Run end-to-end tests
yarn test:e2e
```

## Troubleshooting CI/CD Issues

### Common CI Failures

1. **Linting errors**:
   - Run `yarn lint` locally to identify and fix issues
   - Many linting errors can be automatically fixed with `yarn lint:fix`

2. **Test failures**:
   - Check the CI logs to see which tests are failing
   - Run the specific failing tests locally to debug
   - Make sure all tests pass locally before pushing

3. **Dependency issues**:
   - Ensure dependencies are correctly declared in package.json files
   - Use the `"workspace:^"` syntax for internal dependencies
   - Make sure the build order is correct

## Recent Improvements

The CI/CD pipeline has been recently optimized:

1. **Removed Unnecessary Dependencies**: Eliminated system dependencies (libvips-dev, libjpeg-dev, libpng-dev) that were not required for the project, simplifying the build process.

2. **Removed Sharp Configuration**: Removed Sharp-specific configuration from the workflow, as the project doesn't use image processing functionality.

3. **Build Order**: Ensured proper build order (cidr-utils → core → cli) to prevent module resolution issues.

4. **Workspace Dependencies**: Fixed workspace dependency references using the `"workspace:^"` syntax to ensure proper linking between packages.

These improvements have streamlined the build process and made it more reliable.

## Conclusion

The CI/CD pipeline is a critical part of the Subnetter project, ensuring code quality, automating testing, and streamlining the release process. By leveraging GitHub Actions and other tools, we maintain a consistent and reliable development workflow that helps the project deliver high-quality software.
