Welcome to the Subnetter guides section! Here you'll find practical, hands-on guides for implementing Subnetter in various scenarios. These guides provide detailed configurations, best practices, and real-world examples to help you get the most out of Subnetter.

## Available Guides

### [Hierarchical CIDR Allocation for Multi-Cloud Networks](./hierarchical-cidr-allocation/)

A detailed exploration of how Subnetter's hierarchical approach to IP address allocation solves complex networking challenges. This guide covers:

- Solving IP addressing challenges across multiple cloud providers and accounts
- Dramatic simplification of firewall and security group rules
- Example configurations for multi-cloud and multi-account scenarios
- Operational benefits of hierarchical allocation at scale
- Best practices for implementing a hierarchical addressing scheme

This guide is ideal for network architects and cloud engineers managing complex environments who want to reduce operational complexity and create a scalable network foundation.

### [Kubernetes Network Design](./kubernetes-network-design/)

A comprehensive guide to designing multi-availability zone Kubernetes network architectures. This guide covers:

- The 3-AZ high availability architecture pattern
- Optimal subnet sizing for Kubernetes deployments
- IP space efficiency analysis and recommendations
- Implementation strategies with Subnetter
- Real-world examples with specific CIDR allocations

This guide is particularly useful for organizations running Kubernetes workloads across multiple availability zones who need to ensure high availability while efficiently utilizing IP address space.

## Coming Soon

We're working on additional guides that will cover:

- Multi-Cloud CIDR Allocation Strategy
- Automating Network Deployment with Terraform
- IPv4 to IPv6 Migration Planning
- Enterprise Network Design for Large Organizations
