# Integrations

Subnetter can integrate with external systems to synchronize IP address allocations, validate against existing infrastructure, and maintain a single source of truth for your network planning.

## Available Integrations

### NetBox

[NetBox](/subnetter/integrations/netbox/) is an open-source IP Address Management (IPAM) and Data Center Infrastructure Management (DCIM) tool. Subnetter's NetBox integration enables:

- **Export allocations** — Push planned network allocations to NetBox as the source of truth
- **Validate against NetBox** — Check for conflicts between planned allocations and existing data
- **Import from NetBox** — Generate Subnetter configurations from existing NetBox prefixes
- **Idempotent operations** — Support for dry-run mode and incremental updates

## Coming Soon

Future integrations under consideration:

- **Nautobot** — NetBox fork with additional automation features
- **Infoblox** — Enterprise IPAM integration
- **phpIPAM** — Open-source IPAM alternative
- **Terraform** — Infrastructure as code integration
