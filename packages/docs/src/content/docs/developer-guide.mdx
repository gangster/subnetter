## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or later, v22+ recommended)
- Yarn (the project uses Yarn via the yarn releases file)

### Installing and Configuring Yarn

This project uses Yarn with the zero-install configuration (yarn files are checked into the repository). We also use Yarn Workspaces to manage the monorepo structure. This section provides instructions for installing and configuring Yarn on various operating systems.

#### macOS

1. Install Node.js using Homebrew:
   ```bash
   brew install node@20
   ```

2. No need to install Yarn globally as the project uses Yarn from the `.yarn/releases` directory.

3. Verify you can use Yarn in the project:
   ```bash
   # After cloning the repository
   cd subnetter
   ./yarn --version
   ```

#### Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)

1. Install Node.js:
   ```bash
   # Add NodeSource repository
   curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_20.x | sudo -E bash -
   
   # Install Node.js
   sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
   ```

2. No need to install Yarn globally as the project uses Yarn from the `.yarn/releases` directory.

#### Linux (Fedora/RHEL)

1. Install Node.js:
   ```bash
   # Enable NodeSource repository
   sudo dnf module enable nodejs:20
   
   # Install Node.js
   sudo dnf install -y nodejs
   ```

2. No need to install Yarn globally as the project uses Yarn from the `.yarn/releases` directory.

#### NixOS

1. Add Node.js to your configuration:
   
   In your `configuration.nix`:
   ```nix
   environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
     nodejs_20
   ];
   ```

   Or if using home-manager, in your `home.nix`:
   ```nix
   home.packages = with pkgs; [
     nodejs_20
   ];
   ```

2. No need to install Yarn globally as the project uses Yarn from the `.yarn/releases` directory.

#### Windows

1. Install Node.js:
   - Download the Node.js installer from [the official website](https://nodejs.org/)
   - Run the installer and follow the installation wizard
   - Make sure to check the box for "Automatically install the necessary tools"

2. No need to install Yarn globally as the project uses Yarn from the `.yarn/releases` directory.

#### WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux)

1. Install WSL2 if you haven't already:
   ```powershell
   # In PowerShell (Admin)
   wsl --install
   ```

2. Install your preferred Linux distribution from the Microsoft Store

3. Follow the Linux installation instructions above for your specific distribution

#### Understanding the Yarn Zero-Install Configuration

This project uses Yarn with "Zero-Install" configuration, meaning:

1. The `.yarn/releases/yarn-sources.cjs` file is checked into the repository
2. The `.yarnrc.yml` file configures Yarn with these key settings:
   ```yaml
   compressionLevel: mixed
   
   enableGlobalCache: false
   
   nodeLinker: node-modules
   
   yarnPath: .yarn/releases/yarn-sources.cjs
   ```
   
   - `compressionLevel: mixed` optimizes the compression of dependencies
   - `nodeLinker: node-modules` uses the classic node_modules resolution strategy
   - `enableGlobalCache: false` ensures dependencies are stored project-locally 
   - `yarnPath` specifies the location of the Yarn binary included in the repo

3. The `package.json` configures workspaces:
   ```json
   "workspaces": [
     "packages/*"
   ]
   ```

This configuration provides several benefits:

- **No global Yarn installation needed**: The project uses the version from `.yarn/releases`
- **Deterministic builds**: Identical dependency installation across all environments
- **Simplified onboarding**: New contributors don't need to install Yarn separately
- **Workspace management**: Packages can reference each other and share dependencies

### Using Yarn Commands

Since the Yarn binary is included in the repository, always use `./yarn` instead of `yarn` when running commands from the project root:

```bash
# Install dependencies
./yarn install

# Build all packages
./yarn build

# Run tests
./yarn test
```

When inside the repository, you can also set up a shell alias to simplify commands:

```bash
alias y="./yarn"
```

Then use `y` for all Yarn commands:

```bash
y build
y test
```

### Package Versioning and Dependencies

All packages in the monorepo share the same version number, currently `1.3.1`. This synchronized versioning approach simplifies release management and ensures compatibility between packages.

#### Version Management

1. **Root package.json**: Contains the main version:
   ```json
   {
     "name": "subnetter",
     "version": "1.3.1",
     // ...
   }
   ```

2. **Workspace packages**: Each has its own version that matches the root:
   ```json
   {
     "name": "@subnetter/core",
     "version": "1.3.1",
     // ...
   }
   ```

3. **Automatic updates**: The `update-versions.js` script ensures versions stay synchronized.

#### Dependencies Between Packages

Workspace packages can depend on each other:

```json
// packages/cli/package.json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@subnetter/core": "1.3.1",
    // ...
  }
}
```

This allows direct imports between packages without publishing to npm first:

```typescript
// In packages/cli/src/index.ts
import { CidrAllocator } from '@subnetter/core';
```

#### External Dependencies

Dependencies at the root level are available to all packages. Package-specific dependencies are defined in each package's `package.json`.

The project uses dependency resolution to handle conflicts and ensure consistent versions:

```json
// Root package.json
"resolutions": {
  "esbuild": "0.19.8",
  "chalk": "4.1.2",
  "strip-ansi": "6.0.1",
  "string-width": "4.2.3",
  "ansi-styles": "4.3.0",
  "is-fullwidth-code-point": "3.0.0",
  "emoji-regex": "8.0.0",
  "eastasianwidth": "0.2.0"
}
```

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gangster/subnetter.git
   cd subnetter
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. Build the packages:
   ```bash
   yarn build
   ```

4. Run tests to verify your setup:
   ```bash
   yarn test
   ```

## Build Process

Subnetter uses TypeScript for all packages, with a build process that compiles the TypeScript code to JavaScript.

### Building the Project

The Subnetter project uses TypeScript's project references for efficient and reliable builds:

```bash
# Install dependencies first
./yarn install

# Build all packages
./yarn build
```

#### TypeScript Project References

The project uses TypeScript's project references to manage the build process:

1. **Root Configuration**: The root `tsconfig.json` defines shared compiler options and references to package-specific configs:
   ```json
   {
     "compilerOptions": {
       "target": "ES2022",
       "module": "CommonJS",
       "strict": true,
       // ... other options
     },
     "references": [
       { "path": "./packages/core" },
       { "path": "./packages/cli" }
     ]
   }
   ```

2. **Package-Specific Configurations**: Each package has its own `tsconfig.json`:
   ```json
   // packages/core/tsconfig.json
   {
     "extends": "../../tsconfig.json",
     "compilerOptions": {
       "outDir": "./dist",
       // ... package-specific options
     },
     "include": ["src/**/*"]
   }
   ```

3. **BuildInfo Files**: Incremental builds are enabled, generating `.tsbuildinfo` files to track dependencies and changes.

#### Build Scripts

The build system is orchestrated through npm scripts defined in `package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
  "clean": "rm -rf packages/*/dist packages/*/tsconfig.tsbuildinfo",
  "build": "yarn build:core && yarn build:cli",
  "build:core": "yarn workspace @subnetter/core build",
  "build:cli": "yarn workspace @subnetter/cli build",
  "build:docs": "yarn workspace @subnetter/docs build",
  "dev": "tsc -b --watch"
}
```

Each package also has its own build scripts:

- **Core Package**: Basic TypeScript compilation
  ```json
  "scripts": {
    "build": "tsc -b",
    "clean": "rm -rf dist tsconfig.tsbuildinfo"
  }
  ```

- **CLI Package**: TypeScript compilation plus executable script generation
  ```json
  "scripts": {
    "build": "tsc -b && yarn build:bin",
    "build:bin": "node scripts/create-bin.js"
  }
  ```

- **Docs Package**: TypeScript compilation plus static site generation
  ```json
  "scripts": {
    "build": "yarn generate-api-docs && astro build && node postbuild.js"
  }
  ```

#### Build Process Flow

1. When you run `yarn build`, it builds packages in the correct dependency order:
   - First the core package is built (`@subnetter/core`)
   - Then the CLI package (`@subnetter/cli`), which depends on core
   - Documentation can be built separately

2. The TypeScript compiler follows project references to ensure dependent projects are built first.

3. Each package's build process:
   - Compiles TypeScript to JavaScript
   - Generates type declaration files (`.d.ts`)
   - Creates source maps for debugging

#### CLI Binary Generation

The CLI package includes a special step to create an executable binary:

1. The `build:bin` script runs `create-bin.js` which:
   - Creates a `bin` directory
   - Generates a `subnetter` executable file with a Node.js shebang
   - Sets executable permissions (chmod 755)

```javascript
// packages/cli/scripts/create-bin.js
#!/usr/bin/env node

const fs = require("fs");
const path = require("path");

// Define paths
const binDir = path.resolve(__dirname, "../bin");
const binFile = path.resolve(binDir, "subnetter");

// Create bin directory if it doesn't exist
if (!fs.existsSync(binDir)) {
  fs.mkdirSync(binDir, { recursive: true });
}

// Create the bin file with the appropriate shebang
const binContent = `#!/usr/bin/env node

require("../dist/index.js");
`;

// Write the bin file
fs.writeFileSync(binFile, binContent);

// Make the bin file executable
fs.chmodSync(binFile, "755");
```

2. The CLI package.json specifies this binary in the `bin` field:
```json
"bin": {
  "subnetter": "./bin/subnetter.js"
}
```

3. When the package is installed globally, npm/yarn creates a symlink to this binary in the user's PATH.

#### Development Mode

For active development, use the watch mode:

```bash
./yarn dev
```

This starts TypeScript in watch mode, rebuilding files as you make changes.

## Development Workflow

### Branch Strategy

We follow the GitHub Flow branching strategy:

1. Create a feature branch from `main`
2. Make your changes
3. Open a pull request to `main`
4. After review, merge the pull request

### Commit Messages

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for commit messages. This helps generate accurate changelogs and determine version bumps.

Examples:
- `feat: add new subnet type validation`
- `fix: correct CIDR overlapping detection`
- `docs: update installation instructions`
- `test: add test for edge case in CIDR allocation`
- `refactor: simplify allocation algorithm`

The commit message format is enforced by commitlint, which runs as a pre-commit hook.

### Pull Request Process

1. Ensure your code passes all tests and linting
2. Update documentation if necessary
3. Open a pull request with a clear description of the changes
4. Address review comments
5. Once approved, the pull request will be merged

## Testing

Subnetter has a comprehensive testing strategy that includes multiple levels of testing.

### Unit Tests

Unit tests focus on individual components and are located in the `tests` directory of each package.

To run unit tests:

```bash
yarn test                # Run all tests
yarn test:coverage       # Run tests with coverage reporting
```

To run tests for a specific package:

```bash
yarn workspace @subnetter/core test
yarn workspace @subnetter/cli test
```

### End-to-End Tests

End-to-end tests verify the complete workflow and are located in the `__tests__/e2e` directory.

To run end-to-end tests:

```bash
yarn test:e2e
```

### Test Structure

Tests are organized by package and follow a consistent structure:

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and classes
  - Located in `packages/<package>/tests/`
  - Named `*.test.ts`
- **End-to-End Tests**: Test complete workflows
  - Located in `__tests__/e2e/`
  - Named `*.test.ts`

### Testing Guidelines

- Every feature should have corresponding tests
- Aim for high test coverage (>90% for core functionality)
- Use descriptive test names that indicate what is being tested
- Use mocks sparingly and only when necessary
- End-to-end tests should use realistic configurations

## Code Style and Conventions

### TypeScript and ESLint

We use TypeScript for type safety and ESLint for static code analysis. Our configuration is based on recommended settings with custom rules specified in `eslint.config.js`.

To lint your code:

```bash
yarn lint          # Check for linting issues
yarn lint:fix      # Automatically fix linting issues
```

We use TypeScript 5.8.x for the core package and 5.7.x for other packages.

### Code Formatting

We use Prettier for code formatting. The configuration is in `.prettierrc.json`.

### Naming Conventions

- **Files**: Use kebab-case for filenames (e.g., `cidr-allocator.ts`)
- **Classes**: Use PascalCase for class names (e.g., `CidrAllocator`)
- **Functions and Variables**: Use camelCase for functions and variables (e.g., `processRegions`)
- **Interfaces**: Use PascalCase for interfaces (e.g., `Allocation`)
- **Enums**: Use PascalCase for enums and enum members

### Documentation

- Use JSDoc comments for all public APIs
- Include examples in documentation when helpful
- Keep documentation up to date with the code

## Contribution Guidelines

We welcome contributions from the community! Here's how you can contribute:

### Finding Issues to Work On

- Check the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/gangster/subnetter/issues) for tasks
- Look for issues labeled "good first issue" for a good starting point

### Submitting Changes

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch from `main`
3. Make your changes
4. Ensure your code passes tests and linting
5. Open a pull request
6. Address review comments

### Code Review Process

All code changes go through a review process:

1. Automated checks (CI/CD pipeline)
2. Code review by at least one maintainer
3. Address feedback
4. Final approval and merge

## Release Process

We use semantic versioning (SemVer) for releases.

### Version Bumping

Versions are bumped automatically based on commit messages:
- `fix`: Patch version bump
- `feat`: Minor version bump
- `feat!` or `fix!`: Major version bump (breaking changes)

### Release Workflow

1. Merge pull requests to `main`
2. The CI/CD pipeline runs tests on multiple platforms
3. If all tests pass, the release job creates releases automatically
4. Packages are published to GitHub Packages
5. Release notes are generated based on commit messages

### Package Publishing

Our packages are published to GitHub Packages. The package configuration includes:

```json
"publishConfig": {
  "registry": "https://npm.pkg.github.com",
  "access": "public"
}
```

### Manual Release

If necessary, manual releases can be triggered:

```bash
npm run release
```

## Common Development Tasks

5. Add tests for the new format

## Troubleshooting

### Common Build Issues

- **TypeScript Errors**: Check if your TypeScript version matches the project requirements
- **Missing Dependencies**: Run `yarn install` to ensure all dependencies are installed
- **Out-of-Memory**: Increase Node.js memory limit with `NODE_OPTIONS=--max_old_space_size=4096`

### Testing Issues

- **Failed Tests**: Check the error message for details
- **Timeout Issues**: Consider increasing the test timeout value
- **Coverage Issues**: Ensure you have written tests for all code paths 

## CI/CD Pipeline

The project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment. For a comprehensive overview of the CI/CD pipeline, including workflows for testing, building, releasing, and documentation publishing, see the [CI/CD Pipeline documentation](../../project/ci-cd-pipeline/).

The CI/CD pipeline:
- Automatically builds and tests code on multiple platforms (Ubuntu and macOS)
- Validates pull requests before merging
- Creates releases based on conventional commits
- Publishes packages to GitHub Packages
- Deploys documentation to GitHub Pages
- Keeps dependencies up-to-date via Dependabot

You can run the same checks locally that run in the CI pipeline using the commands documented in the [Testing](#testing) section.

### Package Publication

The project is set up to automatically publish packages to the npm registry when a new version is released. This is handled by the CI/CD pipeline.

## Working with the CIDR Utilities Package

The `@subnetter/cidr-utils` package provides low-level utilities for IP address and CIDR manipulation. This package can be used both internally (by the core package) or as a standalone utility library for other projects.

### Architecture and Design

The CIDR utils package was designed with the following principles:

1. **Zero dependencies**: Pure JavaScript/TypeScript implementation without external dependencies
2. **TypeScript-first**: Comprehensive type definitions for all functions and data structures
3. **Comprehensive API**: Complete set of utilities for all common CIDR operations
4. **Modular design**: Each file has a single responsibility and a clean API
5. **Thorough testing**: Extensive unit test coverage, including edge cases

### Key Components

- **IP Address Manipulation** (`ip.ts`): Functions to convert between string, numeric, and octet representations
  - `ipv4ToNumber`: Convert an IPv4 address string to its numeric representation
  - `numberToIpv4`: Convert a numeric representation to an IPv4 address string
  - `createIpAddress`: Create an IP address object with various formats
  
- **CIDR Parsing** (`parser.ts`): Functions to parse and normalize CIDR notation
  - `parseIpv4Cidr`: Parse a CIDR string into its components (address and prefix length)
  - `normalizeCidr`: Normalize a CIDR string to its canonical form
  
- **CIDR Validation** (`validator.ts`): Functions to validate CIDR notation
  - `isValidIpv4Cidr`: Check if a string is a valid CIDR
  - `validateIpv4Cidr`: Validate a CIDR with detailed error reporting
  
- **Subnet Calculations** (`calculator.ts`): Functions for subnet calculations
  - `calculateNetworkAddress`: Calculate the network address of a CIDR
  - `calculateBroadcastAddress`: Calculate the broadcast address of a CIDR
  - `calculateUsableIps`: Calculate the number of usable IPs in a CIDR
  - `isIpInCidr`: Check if an IP address is within a CIDR range
  - `doCidrsOverlap`: Check if two CIDRs overlap
  
- **Subnet Allocation** (`subnet.ts`): Functions for subnet allocation
  - `subdivideIpv4Cidr`: Divide a CIDR into smaller subnets
  - `findNextAvailableCidr`: Find the next available CIDR block in a range

### Using the CIDR Utils Package

You can use the CIDR utils package directly in your code:

```typescript
// Import specific functions
import { 
  isValidIpv4Cidr, 
  calculateUsableIps, 
  ipv4ToNumber 
} from '@subnetter/cidr-utils';

// Validate a CIDR
const validCidr = isValidIpv4Cidr('10.0.0.0/24'); // true

// Calculate usable IPs
const usableIps = calculateUsableIps('10.0.0.0/24'); // 254

// Convert IP to number
const ipNumber = ipv4ToNumber('10.0.0.1'); // 167772161
```

### Extending CIDR Utils

When adding new functionality to the CIDR utils package:

1. Identify the appropriate file based on the type of functionality
2. Add well-documented, strongly-typed functions
3. Write comprehensive tests, including edge cases
4. Export the new functions in the `index.ts` file
5. Update dependencies (if needed) in the core and CLI packages

### CI/CD Considerations

The `cidr-utils` package sits at the bottom of the dependency tree, so it needs to be built first:

```bash
# Build cidr-utils first
yarn workspace @subnetter/cidr-utils build

# Then build dependent packages
yarn workspace @subnetter/core build
yarn workspace @subnetter/cli build
```

The CI/CD pipeline is configured to build packages in the correct order automatically.
