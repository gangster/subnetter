| Account-Level Overrides | âœ… Implemented | Support for overriding base CIDRs at the account level |
| Base CIDR Override via CLI | âœ… Implemented | Ability to override base CIDR through command-line options |
| CIDR Tracking | âœ… Implemented | System for tracking allocated CIDRs to prevent overlaps |
| Schema Evolution | ðŸŸ¨ Partial | Basic normalization of older formats, but limited |
| Error Handling | âœ… Implemented | Comprehensive error handling with error hierarchy, error codes, context information, and actionable help text |
| Logging | âœ… Implemented | Configurable logging system with multiple levels and output options |
| Testing Coverage | âœ… Implemented | Comprehensive test suite with >90% line coverage for core functionality, including unit, integration, and E2E tests |
| Extension Points | ðŸŸ  Planned | Architecture supports extension but formal interfaces not yet implemented |
| IaC Outputs | ðŸŸ  Planned | Only CSV output currently implemented |
| Plugin System | ðŸŸ  Planned | Not yet implemented |

## Planned Enhancements

### High Priority

1. **Comprehensive Testing**
   - Expand unit test coverage to 90%+
   - Implement integration tests for all major components
   - Add end-to-end tests for common use cases
   - Integrate with CI/CD pipeline for continuous validation

### Medium Priority

2. **Infrastructure as Code Integration**
   - Add Terraform HCL output format
   - Support CloudFormation template generation
   - Create Pulumi/CDK integration hooks

3. **Visualization Tools**
   - Add graphical representation of CIDR hierarchies
   - Create interactive visualization in CLI
   - Generate diagrams for documentation

4. **IPAM Integration**
   - Integrate with existing IP Address Management solutions
   - Enable synchronization of allocations with enterprise IPAM systems
   - Support import/export of allocation data from common IPAM tools

### Low Priority

5. **Plugin System**
   - Create formal extension interface
   - Support custom allocation strategies
   - Enable third-party output formats
   - Provide integration points for external tools

6. **IPv6 Support**
   - Extend the tool to handle IPv6 allocations
   - Support dual-stack configurations
   - Add IPv6-specific validation rules

7. **Web Interface**
