# Subnetter: IPv4 CIDR Allocation Tool

## Executive Summary

Subnetter is a comprehensive tool designed to automate the allocation of IPv4 CIDR blocks across cloud infrastructures. It consists of three main components:

1. **Core Library (`@subnetter/core`)**: A TypeScript library that provides the core CIDR allocation functionality.
2. **Command-Line Interface (`@subnetter/cli`)**: A CLI tool that leverages the core library to generate CIDR allocations.
3. **Documentation Site (`@subnetter/docs`)**: A comprehensive documentation site built with Astro and Starlight.

The tool is designed to eliminate manual IP allocation errors, provide consistent subnet allocation across multiple cloud providers, and support infrastructure-as-code practices.

## Business Objectives

- **Eliminate Manual IP Allocation Errors**: Automate the process of allocating IP address ranges to prevent overlapping CIDRs and configuration errors.
- **Support Multi-Cloud Architectures**: Provide consistent IP allocation across AWS, Azure, and GCP environments.
- **Enable Infrastructure-as-Code**: Generate deterministic, reproducible IP allocations that can be integrated into infrastructure-as-code workflows.
- **Simplify Network Planning**: Provide a clear, hierarchical approach to IP space management across accounts, regions, and availability zones.

## Key Features

### Core Features (Implemented)

- **Hierarchical IPv4 CIDR Allocation**: Allocate IP address ranges in a hierarchical manner (account → region → availability zone → subnet).
- **Multi-Cloud Provider Support**: Support for AWS, Azure, and GCP with provider-specific region naming conventions.
- **Flexible Configuration System**: JSON/YAML configuration files with Zod schema validation.
- **Deterministic Allocation**: Same input configuration always produces the same allocation results.

interface CloudProvider {
  name: string;
  regions: string[];
}
```

### Cloud Configuration

```typescript
interface CloudConfig {
  baseCidr?: string;
  regions: string[];
}
```

interface Account {
  name: string;
  clouds: Record<string, CloudConfig>;
}
```

interface Region {
  name: string;
  availabilityZones: string[];
  cidr?: string;
}
```

  accounts: Account[];
  subnetTypes: Record<string, number>;
}
```

## Core CIDR Allocation Engine

The CIDR allocation engine is the heart of the system and follows these principles:

1. **Hierarchical Allocation**: IP space is divided hierarchically from a base CIDR:
   - Base CIDR → Account CIDRs → Region CIDRs → AZ CIDRs → Subnet CIDRs

2. **Deterministic Allocation**: The same input configuration always produces the same allocation results.

3. **No Overlapping CIDRs**: The system ensures that allocated CIDRs do not overlap.

4. **Optimal Prefix Length Calculation**: The system automatically calculates optimal prefix lengths based on the number of subnets needed at each level.

5. **Provider-Specific Logic**: The system handles provider-specific region naming conventions and requirements.

### Allocation Algorithm

1. Start with a base CIDR (e.g., `10.0.0.0/8`)
2. Divide it among accounts (or cloud-specific account configurations)
3. For each account, divide its CIDR among regions
4. For each region, divide its CIDR among availability zones (typically 3 per region)
5. For each AZ, divide its CIDR among subnet types (e.g., public, private, database)

### CIDR Tracking

The system includes a `CidrTracker` component that:
1. Keeps track of all allocated CIDRs
2. Ensures no overlapping occurs
3. Validates new allocations against existing ones
4. Provides debugging information about the allocation state

## Configuration System

The configuration system uses Zod for schema validation and supports both JSON and YAML formats. The configuration file specifies:

1. **Base CIDR**: The starting IP address range (e.g., `10.0.0.0/8`)
2. **Prefix Lengths**: Optional specific prefix lengths for account, region, and AZ levels
3. **Cloud Providers**: List of supported cloud providers
4. **Accounts**: List of accounts with cloud-specific configurations
5. **Subnet Types**: List of subnet types with their prefix lengths

### Configuration Validation

Configuration validation occurs in multiple stages:
1. **File Format Validation**: Ensure the file is valid JSON or YAML
2. **Schema Validation**: Validate against the Zod schema
3. **Semantic Validation**: Check for logical constraints like:
   - CIDR blocks must be valid
   - Prefix lengths must be appropriate for each level
   - Cloud provider names must be recognized

### Cloud Provider Support

The system supports three major cloud providers:
1. **AWS**: With regions like `us-east-1`, `us-west-2`, etc.
2. **Azure**: With regions like `eastus`, `westeurope`, etc.
3. **GCP**: With regions like `us-central1`, `europe-west1`, etc.

For each provider, the system automatically handles:
- Region naming conventions
- Availability zone creation patterns
- Provider-specific constraints

## CLI Interface

The CLI provides the following commands:

1. **generate**: Generate IPv4 allocations based on a configuration file
   ```
   subnetter generate -c config.json -o allocations.csv
   ```
   
   Options:
   - `--config, -c`: Path to configuration file (required)
   - `--output, -o`: Path to output CSV file (default: allocations.csv)
   - `--provider, -p`: Filter results by cloud provider
   - `--base-cidr, -b`: Override base IPv4 CIDR block
   - `--verbose, -v`: Enable verbose logging
   - `--log-level, -l`: Set log level (silent, error, warn, info, debug, trace)
   - `--no-color`: Disable colored output
   - `--timestamps`: Include timestamps in log output

2. **validate**: Validate a configuration file without generating allocations
   ```
   subnetter validate -c config.json
   ```
   
   Options:
   - `--config, -c`: Path to configuration file (required)
   - `--verbose, -v`: Enable verbose logging
   - `--log-level, -l`: Set log level (silent, error, warn, info, debug, trace)
   - `--no-color`: Disable colored output
   - `--timestamps`: Include timestamps in log output

## Logging System

The system includes a flexible logging system with:
1. **Multiple Log Levels**: silent, error, warn, info, debug, trace
2. **Component-Specific Loggers**: Each component has its own logger instance
3. **Configurable Output**: Support for colored output and timestamps
4. **Context-Based Filtering**: Logs can be filtered by component
