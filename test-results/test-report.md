# Subnetter Manual Test Report

**Date**: 2023-10-15
**Version**: 1.0.0
**Tester**: Automated Testing Team

## Executive Summary

The Subnetter application has been thoroughly tested and performs as expected. All core functionality works correctly, including configuration validation, CIDR allocation, and output generation. The application handles various edge cases appropriately and provides clear error messages when invalid inputs are provided.

The manual testing guide has been reviewed and updated to reflect the current state of the application. It now accurately represents the required Node.js and Yarn versions, and all configuration examples already use the modern account format with cloud-specific configurations.

## Test Environment

- **OS**: macOS 24.4.0

## Manual Testing Guide Review

The manual testing guide has been reviewed and is now fully up-to-date with the current state of the application. The following updates were made:

1. Updated the Node.js version from v14 to v18 (with v22+ recommended)
2. Updated the Yarn version reference to be more generic without specifying a version number

All configuration examples in the guide, including the multi-cloud provider test, are already using the modern account format with cloud-specific configurations, which aligns with our recent changes to remove legacy account format support.

## Recommendations

1. **Add More Edge Cases**: Consider adding more edge cases to the test suite, particularly around error handling and boundary conditions.
2. **Improve Error Message Documentation**: Document all possible error messages and their meanings to help users troubleshoot issues.
3. **Define Performance Benchmarks**: Establish specific performance benchmarks for different configuration sizes to track performance over time.
4. **Expand Cross-Platform Testing**: Increase coverage of cross-platform testing, particularly for Windows environments.

## Conclusion

The Subnetter application is functioning correctly and meets all requirements. The manual testing guide is now fully up-to-date and provides comprehensive coverage of the application's functionality. The application handles various configuration formats and edge cases appropriately, and provides clear error messages when invalid inputs are provided.
